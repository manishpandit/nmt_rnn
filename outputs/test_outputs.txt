You know that what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in America.
And I always tell the people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather clothes and never nobody had chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something you fell in somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went up to her every week in the lunch bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom <unk>
It was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults never got to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio, and please get that man that you have already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to tell you about please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and her family, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you became present in herself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> it around me about half of the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't think it was a snowflake on the other <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they come from the glaciers or <unk> the ice barriers are <unk>
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold themselves down to the end, while others cannot be <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, as well as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> is breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As you melts a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the life cycle.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures that I would like to show you are a B15 iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little bit frequent to be able to see an B15 iceberg going to see an B15 iceberg in the dollar.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I would like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a B15 iceberg <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every single baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of itself, I'm not going to pay attention to.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm is tied to the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joined the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll come back to talk about them later.
And in my activity we tend to get two roles.
In one of my roles work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people started getting the anatomy -- this is, in human bodies, human bodies -- how have they considered the body fluids.
The other role that performance works in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology is not fit in <unk> male and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't fit into the common form of male or female forms.
For example, this is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene, of the chromosome -- and it says to the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that would be <unk>
And then in the <unk> life, the testicles are making testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the Yentl syndrome?
So there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops following a <unk> course.
When you look at the baby as a little girl.
It's a little girl, it's raised as a young girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone is going to realize that something is happening.
And then when they do tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think this is a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, like men, we have a body called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know the <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example, a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old boy who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and with sexual relations with her, he was carrying a life like a kid and had just discovered that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had <unk> <unk> and in the uterus the <unk> glands, they were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems that was caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- that they have <unk> <unk> wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know well why that happens to happen.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with this kind of bodies have been <unk> twins or <unk> twins or <unk> they are tested in <unk> surgeries -- it's not to be able to get rid of a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are tested in various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is mostly based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an identity <unk> identity -- being black means to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
<unk>
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk>
So imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in the same body.
The highest thing is last year in the past year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> put on the trial of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "How do you test you are going to do to determine whether <unk> is man, or <unk>
And I had to tell you the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature does not trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more you get to the science, more we have to admit that these <unk> categories were thought they were very much stable categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories, are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we <unk> in the fact of them in just a few <unk>
And as we made it in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable place that we need to recognize that the <unk> categories, that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all the <unk> of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in principle and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body gets human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
And our ancestors never had to stand up with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot of him would put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it still not <unk>
If I stopped moving it out.
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, I'm making people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
It turns out that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did -- I find myself every way watching that <unk> <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as everybody remember what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right thing to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that the political power was going to get the right power of blood passed from the grandfather passed from the grandfather and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replace it for a new concept and that concept that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were <unk> two things.
And I was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power to be passed on a vague idea of birth to birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look for example, for example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talked about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And consequently, we were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of Human Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people who had <unk> <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows in the Civil Rights Civil Rights saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in color that are going to be <unk> on the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep doing certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't mean that we had to focus on anatomy.
I don't mean that the age of five years was supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try and figure out what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
And Henry, on the contrary, was born on the term: was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry <unk> the right to sexual consent, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that, because I have a different age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it is <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the Hebrew <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
He doesn't have the same rights as marriage as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in every state with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went down so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas has decided that to get married with a man don't have to get a chromosome, and to get married with a woman you have to have chromosome down.
Now, in practice, they don't do tests for people to <unk>
But this is also very odd because of the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> speech, <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we had to be able to deal with this to help people, because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some human services I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more positive decisions, intelligent and <unk> about their sexual relations than I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to drive this current thinking in relation to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> unless they are willing to ban a sex shift in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twin twins to then pick them up, and so <unk> their name.
But when the phone was asked by the sake of the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, to tell me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has considered the political asylum rather than the separation of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean, I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it might have been, if we had given more involvement in the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
For years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my consultants who knew I was interested in feminism -- I thought I was interested in <unk> I considered me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about feminine <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with getting rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing feminine on the <unk>
But the more I thought about your question, more than there is something feminine on the <unk>
I mean, that there could be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the <unk> were very <unk> to find the way to protect people in the state, it is possible that there are more <unk> to this concept, maybe we have enriched the concept of protection that we might have enriched <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we look at democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect union of thinking about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily be able to <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But it just <unk> by the apartments.
So imagine that half the ones that you wanted to live in apartments are either owners and the other half still <unk> to do it.
They could try and increase the ability to make it <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building block.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, build a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of <unk>
So I proposed that governments would have new areas of reform high high school areas to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk> <unk>
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, which is <unk> <unk> that was <unk> with a platform in which promise of reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk to TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of standards, like those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and they're usually the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, "Do this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> that in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was an abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, and he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I was called and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that I was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a photo of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is just over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that was going to be <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
And the leader of the Congress came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I felt the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There was a choice of a city that might be able to go in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away into the North.
And we also need new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help of countries -- they could benefit from countries that would help them to set up and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all be trusting the <unk> so that they could all be trusted.
We went and we saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could be quite a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional conflict, was <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over again in another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting in the 21 to February of February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in North Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years after they spent four years and getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to <unk> and maybe allow it to operate under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing his Supreme Court to be the court of the last century for this new justice system.
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they have solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to go into the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a work, sometimes they are <unk> mothers, who have to make the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you think about insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- which is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find himself, and more recently, photograph and publish my blog <unk> and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I'm going to know people who are looking at my money -- my money is going to be good <unk> My look at <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be a size?
Would I like it?
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I used for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> interior for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I would like to show you the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk> <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You can almost always see about 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it cost me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- you don't just get <unk> you get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you put in.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remind them of their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> The trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside the outside, you don't look at <unk>
So there's no excuse for no one of this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> are going with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and unique way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people came close to me this week for what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another little crazy, colorful suit, if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some of them were <unk> for one of these extreme things, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this, with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a child playing on a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that park bar showed him a valuable lesson, which is that the big things will not allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, play with these little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years ago, you needed quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around every day.
That is not really good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it also didn't be good at my logic.
Because if everything is made out of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it should.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a great approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little bit of a springboard and that <unk> supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost like the same way as a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator and I do all kinds of weird things, but then when someone else comes up with doing those things, because I don't want them to do it, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The companions of the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind going on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal will behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put up the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled it down to a temperature of less than a degree above zero absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act like something.
So we measure their movements.
We found that moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, there was vibrating. and the way it was <unk> it was like a breathing in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when we give it a soft, we were able to make it happen, and that didn't fit at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and you don't know that at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that little metal piece are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
The rest of the time are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom atom and that little metal little than the same as the difference between that little metal little metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece may be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my most logical part of that.
So imagine if you were in a lot of places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it off, and we turned the lights and look at the box, we saw that metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are really quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more profound than that, it's deeper.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
And so many negotiations and stories, we would get it with 17 very interesting museum of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining simply in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I don't get <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you the demo, and then you tell you a couple of interesting things that we have taken from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery -- the MoMA, <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorites, <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways of doing that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the blueprint and with one click, we jumped inside.
They are inside, they want to go at the end of the hallway,
Go forward. Which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 million pixel percent.
And there are many people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10 million pixel down.
It can zoom in around very simple.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression is <unk>
But if you really want to get it up.
So I started play, and I found myself with something happening there.
And I said, "Wait a minute, this seems <unk>
I came in and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I was talking a little bit about a little bit of <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and even deeper and see that you can really reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to remove the image, so you'll see really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we go quickly at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find very details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I had never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online and create your own museum and create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked out -- I've created this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- we just put a <unk> around.
This is <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery, in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these little <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really didn't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they come from museums.
Maybe I should say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media does justice to its artwork that is represented properly represented online.
And the big question that I do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
So I've got something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am <unk> Italian -- all kids in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting at <unk> careers in the last two decades.
There was some time ago, if you wanted to win a <unk> career, you would take a budget and do it for a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you earned the race.
This is what it is that, in engineering, we have a system of control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to answer a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you see besides the cities just wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost every single existing atoms to go back sensors and <unk>
And that is changing the whole interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end of the <unk> he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> a little bit of a <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> -- and we know what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup decades.
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at the activity in the net.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is on the top.
By the late afternoon, there are people here and do <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France. <unk> in Italy.
<unk> people do a quick call and a bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time -- a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night everyone was going to go to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day, everyone went into the center of the winner and the prime minister of then.
And then everyone <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't have done only a few years ago.
Another example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the appearance of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small molecules to track the crap in its shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a <unk> <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
And after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're happening very complicated things, and there is a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that <unk> not disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we dropped a day still still on there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we heard at the beginning, which is push on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> which opens up and <unk>
It was believed as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you go through the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images -- images.
And the curtain is going to open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it very much.
And <unk> a commission to design the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no <unk> no windows, but when you come up with it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears like this case.
Those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there, and he said, "You know, <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture is gone.
This is working.
You see the people <unk> so it inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when you try the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that was still making cuts and water holes, and you had to jump down to <unk>
<unk> noise) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always <unk>
And that's the beauty of doing things for <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
So imagine that those pixels could start flying.
So imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel in the air that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
So imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
It's sort of a flexible screen like this with a normal <unk> in two dimensions.
Or, but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the pixel down.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D pixels to the one that you can get close, and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like this.
When the light turns off, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them being controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> they see it in different <unk>
It's both 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
You can see it all the movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a potential entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible across the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will be <unk> we can go from the digital world of the power of the networks, and the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow may be to deal with the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do we go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but cover the pixel <unk>
You can move it inside, and you can get different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, will serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new summit of London.
You can go into this way.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> by a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way, being stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you most <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would I choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see you.
<unk> I probably had to be the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would we choose memory?
A few more.
And the <unk>
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of us, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference.
And the great collage of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a essay called "Nothing in biology, makes sense of <unk>
But if we actually take biological evolution, consider this is just the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this particular field, well at one end, is of course the most interest in us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids.
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but in fact, mostly the basic engine of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin which is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like the human insulin -- but it's the same protein, it is the same thing as a <unk> <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> gives you the <unk> of <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is an wonderfully controversial environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that can be able to have no effort on their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some rush <unk>
But so forth, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrient nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we tell us the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe <unk> <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and unique <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized some fundamental thing, most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters <unk>
But when organisms appear <unk> things begin to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more doubt.
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still lived in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a gorgeous <unk> dancer.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"It's right." It says George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal on the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy healthy.
I wanted to regain the health of the disease.
I wanted to live more and much more healthy.
Evolution is about going through the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view you and I are kind of <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of us would look at the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution is not necessarily favors of longevity.
It doesn't necessarily belong to the greatest or the toughest or the faster and even the most smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there are fish there, they fish so they have managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look ahead, at the <unk> phase I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've had a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that by medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that it would fit ourselves as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we got so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation we need to have the evolution happen.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the traditional kind, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the <unk> of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when the kind of <unk> planets are going to exist, the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, and a demanding and scary possibility there.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the choices that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First of all, consider the reality that a lot of people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you pick up the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost to 20,000 dollars.
It is not a lot to make the human genome actually make the human genome because it will be increasingly at the scope of all.
They get those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin insulin can make viruses that not only are going to protect themselves but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine in a tobacco vaccine.
Can you imagine something nice about the <unk>
That is reality today, and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg -- and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to have the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a half faster muscle than it allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to pick different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about that, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom you need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine making <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants for.
So I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had taken the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot had the airplane on the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
They get the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words that have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the fences I wanted to get in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about it later on, I got a sentence, which is <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to give you anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as a <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives place to my ego.
And I am sorry for the time that I think about things that I did matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
Within two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please go."
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die not fear.
It's almost like we have been <unk> for it all our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in my daughter -- first grade, not very much artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> <unk> like a small guy.
And to me, that was all the reason for being the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And it was awarded me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live in another way.
You are flying around today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please do not -- but imagine, and how do you get it?
What do you learn that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked on was this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total paralysis,
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that you saw Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're an important person and you have a very good insurance -- you can't really do it.
These are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate <unk>
Does anybody see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, you get marking with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I got married with his brother and her father there at this very very precise time, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside their interior can't <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that lets you project a light on any surface and then with a laser laser, draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
You start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of <unk> and a lot of moving the things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the safe insurance companies, and we got a machine so that you could <unk> it could be a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from the whole corner world from every corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved the garage in the back, and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and that when they <unk> would have removed the frames on the walls and instead there would be <unk>
But for two weeks -- we went to the <unk> ride. My son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and so you can see the <unk>
These are a pair of sunlight that we buy on the <unk> walk of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it up on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up, you build the code -- software goes down in a bad way.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this photo because this photo is the one room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of programming, Tony sessions all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We took the bed to the bed so I could see it.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for the first time his family and friends -- you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking spaces, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of that, he sent us an email and this was what said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like she had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to walk with this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> biodiversity.
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prize were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 <unk> of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up of closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibit called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: If you see something that's not possible, do it happen.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- scenario, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Do it <unk> any thing in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized it, and I would give me a wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want us all to do every day when we find ourselves with something we feel that we need to do -- if it's not me, "Where are I, who?"
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years -- in very often very difficult situations and at the same time as dangerous as a dangerous time.
I went to the <unk> hard.
I worked in a <unk> mine.
Film <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this kind of fun at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career I've been <unk> in horrible ways with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that are <unk> <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that you see convenient and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk of 2011.
What there was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and as content could be <unk> in your face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said, this is a very good opportunity to do it.
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago I would not have been able to have a <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been engaged in terrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could do -- nothing could happen for something so difficult or as dangerous as you could enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to deal with the products, and the marketing and the advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> of marketing and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything on top at the bottom of the end, has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title.
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what? It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure to put all the categories that we can in the film.
You may be able to get a shoe back, and it turns into the most cool shoe you want.
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you <unk> <unk> from "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, make it <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the full process of how it works.
The goal of the <unk> is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That is the full idea of it, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help me help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you get -- it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million a half and a half thousand <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting, but it certainly is going to be worth getting a couple of big brands on it.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> most of the answers will be square.
MS: But it will be hard to be <unk> by the film or to be me?
JK:
MS: ... means you're not optimistic.
So I said, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where it will go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought I <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so was, by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible, to make them so much people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the separate media, is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle worthy of attention that will lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had an <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google --  -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: The <unk> of the simulation of the simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the largest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it reality, it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> -- like that weird bear still <unk>
It's a <unk>   Like this weird rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want you to get a story, but we want them to <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me in some lie -- and that's him staring at me as a <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take out the men and go to companies I would have all my team.
So what I started to look at all of a sudden -- which I started to give me is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, gigantic giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies say that the reason that their movies are so successful is because of the brands associated with them that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you get you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there we would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man to be <unk> to <unk> to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the overall look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
So let's go into the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are more <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, you know, remind you of <unk> the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Woman: Oh.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in <unk>
Man: We talked about something audacious, pretty cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep it cool for you to get better <unk> -- three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, the people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: By the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot gray and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing accessories like <unk> or <unk> and similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: So partly <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Nation <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be a brand -- Tom, but often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings and feelings to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? So I think your world is the world in which you think about as the people around you, your family, the way you live in life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to <unk>
MS: The next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> to what does that love us?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> are you right now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It was a little bit more than you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be afraid. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your <unk> personality -- Morgan <unk> <unk> is a <unk>
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just going to be focused on one of their strong points or in the other instead of focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's the <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements and you actually accommodate it and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands do you do?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful brands and brands understand those things that have gone and come out, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> brand. What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your brand identity, your personality set, what would be?
Are you a <unk> asset. You're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more an asset.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> or bold for <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> magical or mystic -- magical or mystic or <unk>
Or are you most <unk>
You are <unk> sophisticated <unk>
You're like, traditional -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, reliable, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise man, like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they didn't have control, they would not have control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film, how now they use MRI MRI to identify the desire centers in the brain in the brain as much as a movie for movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting a way in the schools with available issues in the United States.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the greatest response or the ones that I've had more successful are those in which I've had to deal with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their donor agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? Did you success?
Well, since the film was sent in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent out, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no television.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talked about to their clients not be part.
I've always believed that if you take the risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people that are pushing it to fail.
I believe that when you train their employees in loss of risk is preparing their entire company to reward them for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll go forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the peril.
And ultimately we have to support transparency.
Now more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to walk a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk, <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who was <unk> they bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket -- I have a check for the <unk> <unk> Foundation, the <unk> Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my help of the next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems.
If we get these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we get a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, hurts the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
Is it easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started to research on <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> these <unk> these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So it was very strange.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab rat in the lab that I didn't like our <unk> <unk> it, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually running in that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that struck my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, say, for example, a coal-fired power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Would you better have to play the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very armed with the people that obviously had all the internal information.
We would take all the points to attack.
You probably even know what the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks like the old language.
I want to tell you how to find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, is called the functions, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to <unk> it with the real world with potential real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's certainly sitting in Iran because it's where most infection has been <unk>
They're not many thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant plant and the <unk> <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back in an effort by <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of <unk>
rotor is that mobile part within the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a very obvious effort to go to the <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and your structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to research scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what is called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called incremental.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
For it not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on ends. and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> were going to have a goal, but from different <unk>
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six volumes and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really saw it.
There is the gray box and the top of the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the entry values for the sensors for example, the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provide code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding <unk>
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the great steam steam is going down, you need to open water valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't be a human operator anymore.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
So what I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> of <unk>
It could be as well, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this load with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology technology for <unk>
It was more possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a large number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start to prepare right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public made in a lot of sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really wants to listen to this?
Yeah.
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> hybrid.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in the other way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be taken and give it skills to <unk> or another one to make users of wheelchair workers, put it back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something that you put in the morning, it gives you a big force -- which is also increasing its speed, and help you, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it with the universe and other entities, <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to take on their back a <unk> charge of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to bring even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on their back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can give you 90 pounds for conventional land for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner, to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of chairs that I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in <unk> chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people very young people, with damage to the column that when they start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is going on very quickly.
His only option, a lot of times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
So let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury on the neocortical column, and as a result of it couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has sensors ...
Not <unk> on crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are a few batteries that give the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they do it with this <unk> very <unk>
AB: I was 24 years on the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a whole feeling and all of the <unk> movement.
Shortly of course, a doctor went into my room at the hospital, and he said, "You know, you'll never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it up to the last ounce of hope of my self.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs <unk> on <unk> climbing rocks and even <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not only of soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of the <unk> to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of rainforests in Congo.
<unk> are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made much emphasis on this sort of thing in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence is still not observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of big apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has occurred for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction is also putting the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of beef and deforestation do that you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter -- hidden down the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know we know them as the apes -- the love, the love, they have sex -- because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their life.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the play, Bonobo sees the <unk> roots of laughter, the dance and human ritual and human ritual and human ritual and human ritual and human ritual and human ritual and human ritual and human ritual and human ritual and human ritual and human.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos of the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male male in a <unk>
Look at what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: "I have <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yes.
So the sexual game is common as much in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust, and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with the water <unk>
I think, like that, we sometimes play themselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us with interact. And then the unexpected connections that we shape are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just tiny samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future that we need to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with bigger and more difficult and older cooperation.
The secret is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To be successful in a world that changes we have to play.
But let's go back to the maximum ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems less appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which the more urgent the <unk>
And so fellow primates, to accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I am responsible for a development organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a <unk>
And in our city, where the volunteers are <unk> to a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a career on the foot of volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what was our task.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end of the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to come up and would save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that he walked into a call to save a live <unk> because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need the home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of <unk>
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went up with the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen <unk> that at that height of the <unk> and went into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back down the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We get rid of the house -- the <unk> for the owner of the house where, as they expected, their treasure. got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the owner of <unk> <unk> by the brave <unk> effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at the other thing was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my <unk> as a volunteer witness to witness acts of generosity and kindness on a logarithmic scale, but also of different acts of courage and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made, or are being <unk> levels of success I'd like to remind you, not wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
We had food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's lives, but every day we are able to influence somebody's life.
So we trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete are built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules that fit a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came all the home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer, to build beautiful or buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block, the world's favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in Bell labs, the next revolution was about <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks and piled on some other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create a much bigger circuits and more complex -- a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just to experts.
I personally didn't think about it that the building blocks of our time are quiet to experts, so I decided to change it.
And eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each one in specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they come together through magnets.
So you can't get it wrong in a wrong way.
<unk> have an colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink input is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with one green and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue one with one green one is making light.
We can put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse module.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, and <unk> <unk> allow us to program to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make it <unk> faster or slower, it just turns out this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection of land.
We want the interactions in the world to be transferred to bricks and <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator will stay open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, the designers without experience in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, which didn't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, "Do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, an open <unk> cannon movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be the scope of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world that we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment focused on focusing on.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on the next side of the video.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that stands for almost everything that is supposed to be, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
And we had a few members of a year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending it to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
So I think <unk>
It's a <unk> of the city of Boston.
Here it comes out as if I would look at a date, but what really seeks is that somebody has been to clean it when it is caught by the snow because he knows that it's not very good by turning fires when it is covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to make it help in this very <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, it was a lot of last year.
They realized that the city had never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that the citizens were <unk> with shovels just in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can embrace a <unk>
You take <unk> when you <unk>
By doing so, you put one name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
That is, you have a low-level component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications of the last year.
But it does something that no other tech technology technology.
And it spreads viral form.
One responsible reason for <unk> City to see this app realized that I could use it, not to be able to use it, but for the citizens to learn from tsunami.
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are steals the batteries.
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just throwing it up to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use using this.
And this has been spread out of <unk> in a natural manner.
If you know a little government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
The computer acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that it was done by the normal canals would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the University of California that until the time has gone past 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that comes into a couple of days and it spreads into viral shape is a kind of shot shot into the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private enterprises, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way we deal with the government of government that has the new <unk> not like a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we work together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
You haven't given the government.
They feel a lot of frustration that you have to do that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us nuts, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government.
And given that government ultimately caused by us -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way it will make change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be able to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the heart of service care and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you're <unk> in the United States.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> at the official knowledge base.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, and put music really hard and see if you get <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston does not have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
We didn't have that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my crap. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamics -- it's different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
And the next report said, "I went to the place, found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
He turned the <unk> I went home.
Good night, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government income to a distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to become <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it could have connected with the government services that you need to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, they <unk> the communities.
If we call animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do that, but you think you're the input from the other.
What our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to pick up a new political leader and then we hope that government will secure our values and we need our needs, but we don't see any changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the superficial layer of <unk>
This is why we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> which keeps us that it belongs to us that we funded as something that we have to operate in our against, that other thing, and we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we need to make the bureaucracy feel sexy.
Because it's where the real government works.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is <unk>
And for the ones that we have taught the government, is time for us to ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see massive challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't do with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> there is only to articulate the systems of the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I was going to <unk> I'm a more generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to speak, and they're not going to talk.
They can express their views on any time and they do it.
So when the government problem is not really important to make your voices.
They're using their hands.
They put their hands on the work for programming applications that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking out <unk> dumping a trash cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like <unk> digital that we're not just consumers we're not just consumers consumers that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't make the citizen <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a swarm of voices, or also going to be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent the most part of my life in community communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact all over the world.
On occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we have seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense, but if they teach feeling, they can have a special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the right, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the whole of the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little and he looked at her, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I would say, <unk> I still feel like my <unk>
And if he told him that no, I would give me again and if I told him that yes, I was left with peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get his time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her and she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on. The two are going to be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I knew I didn't do it. I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just want me to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is that I want you to <unk> that you always want your mother."
He said, "She's my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I do that."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you're always going to do the right thing, although the right thing is <unk>
And I thought it and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I'll do."
Then, finally said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I would never mean <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I will do."
I grew up in the field, in the south village, I have a brother a year older and a sister a year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day, my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and went for the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of all the time.
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today you get it, and you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me at <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I went out with the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, I'm not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> says to all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a <unk> I mean it for the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't see sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe what to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has completely changed our world.
In poor communities, or black, it finds so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black men in the 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, <unk> Baltimore -- Washington, in 50 to 60 percent of all young color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty. If you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth which affects the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not our own problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work some of good curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you have a rights for always if you have a criminal death?
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years, the level of environmental loss will be so high as it was before you get the law of the right to vote.
We have this astonishing silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where I was sentence to 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country jail for children, without any possibility of getting out.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row death.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by citizen crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death is defined by mistake.
On the top nine people have identified one that is innocent that it is <unk> and liberated from the death row.
One rate of mistake, you had an innocent rate in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow it to never fly airplanes if every nine that you would have, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about history -- I'm talking about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the age that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot of this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
There are now older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, you will say, <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of <unk> race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we had <unk> each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we are not willing to engage ourselves with a really and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that couldn't be overcome without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talking about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's very disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
We can never be able to have it here.
The room became silent and a lady said, "No way with our story, we could never get to get into a systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we put people to put people to run people.
Let's go on this.
How do we focus on a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We couldn't make it happen.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by the technology. It will change creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
lately we've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
If you think about them it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
The innovation with innovation, the development is not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also for their heart convictions too.
This connection to the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in crazy despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is almost in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human beings if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we do ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> calls me to go, <unk> comes the <unk>
You want to come and be <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when I <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I went and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks went to me, and he said, "Now, <unk> show me that's that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to be <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences for life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best, and he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> he put my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if anybody kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
So it's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> we don't really judge us to judge our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end of the <unk> the character of a society, not because of the way the rich, powerful people, but the way they treat the poor, they <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do so much force it.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, which has been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, "How can it be?
How can a judge can turn someone in what is not it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night she was wake up <unk> by God, if the judge can turn it into something you don't are, you have to have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was very late I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14-year-old customer -- a tiny, poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer was treated like a <unk> white <unk> a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there were been <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had the <unk> but had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the break for this case stupid.
I got up to the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the car in court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. I walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he looked at me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's you. "It's you. I said yes.
And then I was <unk> and <unk>
And I sat down in the ear, in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I arrived, the judge saw me saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity to <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I went <unk>
People started to. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came the policemen the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. Everyone frightened because we were talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
I kept walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with the face of concern, went into the room and sat behind me, almost at the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed up, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black age.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black man stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this audiences in order to tell this young woman who would keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds up to justice.
That we can't really be human beings -- if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes to do something.
Which is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring, this spring in which is going to make an effort to fund the funds that you spend today on punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't come to nothing.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these money to make the law, the law of security.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say to the ones who believe it is?
<unk> actually the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into string chain, by stealing a bicycle for small crimes against the property, instead of making those resources <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
I think that our philosophy today about punishment does nothing by anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got to be excited about this here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media of the press would rather be able to provide negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe, called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So for a <unk> of stories that would be looking at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news for the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going wrong in worse.
But maybe it won't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is that we get <unk>
Maybe the progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the species extinction -- the shortage of water and <unk> without doubt we do.
As human beings are really good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just ended up with them.
Let's take it in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average per capita income adjusted for inflation has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has dropped from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles hypothesized that global literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to destroy increasingly high and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., most of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water, <unk> <unk> food, mobile and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology and, <unk> their exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> information technology on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the outcome of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop for none of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate is in itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, the friends of <unk> call infinite computation and sensors and networks, and 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on the entire planet, synthetic biology, fuel and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" on Watson, and <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this:
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
So imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service or service that can really affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have made a lot of absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that stuff that's scarce and make it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops in Napoleon ate that <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk> gold.
But the king of <unk> ate out of <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was more than the gold and the <unk>
So that's why the tip of the Washington record is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came out and did the aluminum and made it so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We had this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy electricity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a <unk> planet, for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They arrive at the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about <unk> it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents an hour -- compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk now about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a famous photo <unk> How do you get <unk>
"A pale point <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator -- so <unk>
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water per day from any kind of <unk> saltwater, frozen water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The Coca-Cola president is just going to make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an enormous innovation for this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we will reach 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better moving communication in Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smartphone with the Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted ever.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video, <unk> images, images of books and music, tech technology, now <unk> and lose market value.
Maybe the best comes to it when you get health applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X Prize.
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device that they talk, and because they have <unk> can <unk> can be extracted blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is about 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA virus that wouldn't be able to call the health care and, first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the highest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just moved on the <unk> of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been used to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What desires.
And instead of an economic collapse that we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health -- because of the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy and due to the use of 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of mankind, healthy <unk> and <unk>
How about a few voices never before <unk>
What if we give the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and be able to act for the first time?
What do we find?
And if you're contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small, guided teams of their passion with a clear, of course, they can do things that were <unk> things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end with sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with these college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion for the innovator <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion of new minds that we have to focus on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have over a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples of doing time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that it was <unk> but it didn't.
They actually collect fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught him so much until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that's nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, about <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 inches a black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was getting more than the middle of the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had gone down in half.
I went to five centimeters high.
You have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing will changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat. pretty bad -- he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we had studies in the South China Sea <unk> and, above all, in the Aral Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
I know now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny little bit of <unk> remains that are fish <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then it starts commercial fishing.
The background is a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were <unk>
I once captured a living time.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to a place in which they have never fish.
But you have no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
I would have the point of starting the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes with time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
They didn't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end to the end of the <unk>
And that, in great measure, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies -- they kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose animal animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with great fish.
They get <unk> because the <unk>
You have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them are presented with a captain such as captain such as captain -- and so I watched a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or usually use the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Of course, the enormous role that can be a protected area.
Because with the marine areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past people can't think about because the starting point has been run and very low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which enables them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill the void.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there was gray whales in <unk> bay 500 years ago.
And you have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why would you have <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to giving, is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we will see why the videos are <unk> and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But now the online video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a little percentage is a little percentage makes a myriad of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, in participation and <unk> surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this film out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the popularity of popularity last summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called Mountain Mountain <unk>
I had been published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that was going to go into the very popularity video.
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with some new and interesting things and <unk> them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start the Friday.   Everybody wants to come up the end of a week, the weekend for a week.                                         
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be taken from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask these other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a trends of trends will embrace a point of view, and they share it with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great <unk> then starts talking about it and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a three version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats watching the video.
But what's important here is the creativity I woke up between the Internet of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old version.
And then it became international <unk>
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> who made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form a part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted the <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written that we put this situation?
In a world where two days of video will go up two days of video per minute, just that kind of unexpected it can be <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York City, I admit I wasn't interested in.
Casey <unk> me <unk> <unk> for <unk> but there are often the obstacles that prevent you overseas with <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise of the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> got five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new thing we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of creative communities to participation, the completely unexpected, are characteristics of a new type of media, a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of wonder.
As I said before, one of the celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Not borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, they are hardly the current media, but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose whole life had supported the only unit of unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally entirely in vain.
The words, for so much time -- I was able to go back to it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task, the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat slid into the sea dressed in <unk> ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear were the boundaries, the rape of death.
Like most adults, my mother had been wearing a poison.
So if we were going to ask you, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are out of that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the <unk> engine, and not being able to start for six hours.
But I know I remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I finish the trip was too much for it, and the first apple that I tried to, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to form a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class class -- whose population is made of immigrants from.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The odor of the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English is traded between people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, and then in a car assembly line, working six days, and twice a turn.
Yet, I found time to study English to study English and get a title in I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in English and mathematics, they wouldn't matter what was supposed to be <unk> that generally was <unk>
Two pairs at school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
home, where?
One thing is <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and were listening to our grandmother's movements at the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be woke up until his nightmares started to be <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the angry transition and <unk> and boys were caught between two worlds.
It looked and <unk>
And they were created to centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> <unk> relentless with what I <unk> myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But a lot of people got help over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyers, I was elected by the Australian young president of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to another, but its edges, not <unk>
So <unk> resident a resident in <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in places that had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb -- <unk> -- a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single day and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the boat.
I hadn't been an option.
<unk> told me, <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
And the more I was frankly talking, the more I was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they were living in the edge of the possible.
And even though I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
I had another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a little bit -- new on the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that is so being grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and courage.
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people for the <unk> not <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, I was making a giant tape of soup that all <unk>
They were going to run the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
And after one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't have changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
On the 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused an stir in <unk> and bringing the cause, her own, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel in <unk> when she was killed, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a few minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell ourselves stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"They haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve, in our family, that runs through women.
Because of the ones that we were and how life would get us, we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat was very easily.
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that for you?
However, the privilege of how easy the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in each <unk> the steady rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them a safe, he would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation of how nothing has changed since the old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when we <unk> the great Indian, warrior Indian warrior -- he had <unk> he would pull an arch and with a <unk> to the floor, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed that technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a little girl, my grandfather gave me his pocket silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile clocks and the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them out.
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was sent to this technological world to see how it would use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad -- I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
We put the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
So in several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that magic of childhood to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in the jar were always <unk>
So over here, we have to <unk> the iPad to release fireflies.
And they actually light up your way in what happens?
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every book of fantasy there has always been maps but <unk>
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary of contemporary
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts in the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back in a <unk> child history.
In a history that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out there, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a little girl, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and on a chapter, and a photograph of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a photo of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a photo of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
One child in India says, "Today I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variations of connecting the Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and the video on and through augmented reality. sees a animated group that appear on the inner inner plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves at the screen.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology is moving one to another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves into the natural world and that magic, and a child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to an listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and he asked patients, family and <unk> how <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the greatest problems for what everyone, or maybe not everyone, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> on and turned off.
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I get <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time in which it needs to support it or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before it comes up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> I think you need a light.
That's the best that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some activity in order to have more control in their health.
So from the next week to be available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were going on from their houses, take their blood pressure, they give them their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they return to regain the control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of the cost of care, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video of you.
We all have bicycle controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are <unk>
Where is all the <unk>
And of course, we can find small food chains.
But where is the closest person to help this patient?
We asked us, but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was to do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public -- you see a <unk> please call it <unk> -- where, and when it is open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and other are shut down.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone for Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we would want to <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted companies to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be a instant messaging messaging or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in place.
Please do it and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, these are photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my earlier passion for the drawing of it, but it was a little bit different because when we use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this is a <unk> construction on a <unk>
But it has a unexpected.
And despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like the dark <unk> and <unk> and the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
Take the light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's really not about if it's realistic but what we think is a realistic <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly controversial objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way, you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as it exists.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process as we combine the photographs.
It's really going to combine different realities.
And the things that make a photo look like realistic as realistic I think are those in which we don't even understand the things that surround us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs, it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something is wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these <unk> were taken in the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect path.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of pictures of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that find it really because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing ride.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even did the red house at the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think it takes planning to do.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and at the same realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please do you <unk>
It's a diagram that I took out of a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the overall thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local local networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of others that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step of this represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with multiple curves -- it's something new.
This is a strange thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please switch on the lights.
It was more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> curves on the <unk>
So the answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or a single unit of time, and this would be any measure of technology that would like to give you the diagram, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't mean much.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transport, in a <unk> curve -- it would be really dumb, we see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport it would be as fast as the <unk> last morning, we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There's no <unk> in technological development history of economic growth that every few years, orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they don't go forever.
You can't hold this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or you turn into a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
Being like this, we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way you adopt the world?
Where new is the world?
The transition looks very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference that people talk about the future, and we see the future is still in 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year throughout my life.
But I think it is because something is going on.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that we have.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about a half a half two million years when the Earth was a <unk> <unk> of a lot of chemicals that are moving around it.
If we look at the way that those chemists were <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at the time, there was some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes on their inside.
Some of those drops on oil drops a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring materials out of the outside and so drops grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most expensive cell forms -- those oil <unk> of oil.
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow becomes better at the time of bringing the chemical <unk> they grow more, they grow more chemicals and <unk> more.
I usually lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a way of life, and it was very simple, but things are really interesting when these drops when these drops to the abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well these things, they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without meaning, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to do with it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide to the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this clip of DNA and it was <unk> 10 to the <unk>
So if someone wants to want 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it into a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
So this made these cells happily have a billion years old.
But then another big step came up in which things would be very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information by forming information that cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can trade DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get together in the way, and a <unk>
So that <unk> or <unk> or <unk> -- or that if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community to become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came to come so much that, in fact, they came together so that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next stage is interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities in the communities of many different types of cells working together like one organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not using the heart of the heart, or your muscles or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels that cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level that happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make it more than process in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> inside the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmitting information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of time.
So an organism I could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew evil and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had been building these data processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit fruit as well.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that are enormously important -- evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the necessary time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communications trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea -- an idea in your head.
I'm sitting here by sitting here by emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we turned it into sound, in sound sequences and make something very complicated in another brain.
So that allows us to start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
Now we went through similar periods of <unk> organisms -- <unk> our electronic methods and <unk> and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer <unk> the video, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we would do before.
Now evolution can happen in time.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that they told them led to a billion years per one.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The next few language, the language, and they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, it seems to be just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we look at in this curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life design by designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that job for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer science.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor on that machine machine.
There are billions of millions.
Instead of that, with the <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into machine and the machine that it does something that I didn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine that is an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, computer, you can run a hundred million instructions on the <unk>
You could run these sequences, at random, at random, running all those programs, and take those that are <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to just just <unk> to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to us to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one luckily, he was able to figure out two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better make the <unk>
They would take those and <unk> the rest.
And now we would get the best to ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following an analog <unk> process.
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will raise the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
We had a little bit of <unk>
And it tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that have absolutely absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to be <unk> to see how they work.
They're very strange programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing this.
I was once in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "You know, plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make design processes of design.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering.
We don't understand the whole choices that there is.
In that sense, it is in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
That means <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems like <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the heck we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, this is the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> speaks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you have heard about it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> that we would hear 300.
That means the <unk> bat three of 10 times.
That means launching the ball to the game field without being <unk> and anyone who tries to throw it up to the first base, not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three attempts of 10.
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody 10 <unk> I put it up.
<unk> like the <unk> Ted Williams, the last player on the Women's League of <unk> to run more 400 strikes in a regular season.
Now let's go back to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable -- or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has a record for 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear being, has two coronary <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting this year better.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask:
What do you think about the average of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a nurse, <unk>
Please.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the medicine is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon.
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I included in the term of being perfect.
You never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was in medical school.
I was a student <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was going to be a blood test.
Such a which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> of nurses at the General Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of <unk> <unk> the origin and eye work, <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk>
And they even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the medical school with the impression that if you look at everything, then it would know everything, or as possible, close to the everything, because I would stop the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when we came in the emergency room to go to a cardiologist -- I was going to be able to go to that patient.
And to report the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, what sent me a heart heart failure.
And in these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these are feeding from blood, and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read for.
He gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
He gave him <unk> pills of water, so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent him home.
I actually made two more mistakes anymore.
I sent it to his house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't wake up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him so that the <unk>
And if my boss saw it, I would have been able to bring some information out there.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get a lot of hard care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to his house, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inside that would say, <unk> -- it's not a good idea. Don't you <unk>
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that I was going to be cared for Mrs. <unk> <unk> who is okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said it with complete <unk> "Yes, I think it's okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed the high ambulance and the ambulance along with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, that one.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and walked into the parking parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that point, I did something that I don't do normally, I did something that I don't do normally, I did something that I don't do normally, I did something that I don't do normally, I did something that I don't do
I went through the emergency room service service.
And there was another nurse, not the one who was being cared about the lunch lady before, but the other words said to me three words, those three words that most emergency emergency doctors.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: it remembers you?
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And "Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
By the time of an hour of getting back to his house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a complete shock of <unk>
I would barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive care, and I waited for all of the hope that it was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that never <unk>
He had a binary brain damage.
The family met her.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was going on.
And at the ninth day, they let me go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks later, I was going to get away for it, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat by alone, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame than I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was an <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would give you the things and made sure I didn't get sick.
And I kept getting my questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> why he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
Little soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day <unk> opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if we do the efforts to be perfect for not to make any mistakes, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital hospital in the North Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain on the throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, I was a little <unk>
He sent him penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he was headed to the door, he was still pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my CEO asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can see it on Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it's the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and I went back to work and went back to work, until one and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they went to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
It was an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out normal -- a colleague who was checking the patient perceived to some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, and I called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read it a little bit for <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk> it.
I looked at it and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom left, I called the surgeon.
They were both operated and they recovered they recovered <unk>
But every case was <unk> me <unk>
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful people have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that I'm going to tell me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party, you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital was the wrong leg -- believe it would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It is the system that there are two <unk> which make mistakes and not. Those who can't sleep and the ones that <unk> those who can't sleep and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, such as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you stop medicine to people that make mistakes, we're going to get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and a medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> and medical mistakes to learn how possible, since the first article I wrote for the Toronto <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where the hospital-acquired infections, are increasingly wrong, and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 80,000 Canadian <unk> were killed by medical mistakes, <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going down every two or three years, and we didn't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain coming up with <unk> eyes, and with <unk> and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not <unk> they don't have their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals likely to be wrong, well, not to get anyone.
And what people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art.
And their students <unk> <unk> <unk> your head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a domestic medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> doctor is human, you know human, they accept it and not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving way for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I mean, I'm a human, let's make mistakes.
And I feel so much but I'm effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
You know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick up an American American, are about 70 a day.
Not a lot of a research on a research week for a group of presidents in companies.
The researchers put up the different tasks of the <unk> of these executives and the time that we need to make choices related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Of course, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or so.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you deal with those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the greatest problems of <unk> choosing to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for you to give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this supermarket at the very, very <unk> of that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we had a <unk> water.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion I asked me, why never bought anything?
This is the shelf on <unk> oil.
They had more of 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that were coming up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had <unk> different classes.
<unk> a <unk> put in the store.
We put it out there, six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here is the opposite effect.
What stopped when there was 24, only three percent came to buy <unk>
When they stood up when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they found 24.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> probably less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the animal overload problem affects us in good decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial saving financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the savings decisions for the retirement care of about a million Americans, from about a million Americans, from about 650 plans.
We were interested in seeing if the number of choices available in their savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that they actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the older the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that there was a <unk> to the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there is a negative consequences.
So for the ones who decided to participate, the older the number of options, more people are <unk> to avoid their actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to do to optimize the financial well-being future.
In the previous decade, we have seen three primary negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we make the decisions that the <unk> even when it goes against interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less likely to pick up any more <unk> even though they really leave it better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choosing that awesome <unk>
I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> from one way or another, in different research, so you can test it in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide cut, to get rid of <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> -- there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & 15, saw 15 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> eliminated the products of cats that less <unk> they increased the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and lower cost.
You know that today's <unk> is a 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store. there's about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and there are only 1,400 <unk> a type of tomato tomato tomato sauce.
In the financial savings world, I think that one of the best examples that have arisen on how to manage the best choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the <unk> program.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to an insurance of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it; they can't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation with all of paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds for <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. So anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the two, but I can <unk> and say they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the <unk> of options.
For people to understand differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very specific to be very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use credit cards or credit card than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting, which is going to look at exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we add was that you would give the staff to think about the positive things that they would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to place on their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a singing hallway of magazines.
We saw that in supermarket supermarkets throughout the corridor of the <unk> exhibit of magazines can contain <unk> different types of <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something that you would not have to be <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge fundraising.
I was supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about -- if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase subtle complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good <unk> a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allowed <unk> altogether.
You have to make a thousand decisions to build the car.
And these choices vary in the number of choices that each one.
<unk> color outside the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order that decisions.
So half the clients are going to go from many options, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go in a few options, four <unk> 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to do?
So what about you are.
If you get it, always the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being being lost.
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices at least <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they keep there.
The same information, the number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of information.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick the box of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of <unk> <unk> in all ways you make it to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the issue of the overload of the choice: You know, eliminating alternative alternatives -- we can make it <unk> <unk> we can run more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people who turn their purpose to.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to <unk>
And the more careful that we are in our choices are going to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years of <unk> in East East Germany, if you had a writing machine -- I had to go to the government.
You had to record a piece of text text that was written with the machine.
And so the government could trace the origin of the <unk>
If they found a written line with the wrong message could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of somebody who could do this, how much that it would do, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes you own one and his printer.
That's going on today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, very large amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by illegal <unk> to steal money from our bills when we shop in <unk> or <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards, when we buy the computer <unk>
The U.S. secret service two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a crime that is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going on the worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, which motivate the protests, the protests, the opinions, you motivate you laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who make it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who make it to protest and the last group are the United States the governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority off of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall due to a <unk>
They took the security of the site and spread a <unk>
I asked the last week -- in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives -- I asked one of the leaders if you <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die because of a attack of these?
<unk> is an authority authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do we do <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services like <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they <unk> a foreign authority for foreign authority.
And that was the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the <unk> secret police headquarters in April of 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based headquarters in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government, tools to intercept a large scale the communication of the citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 40,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
That is, Western governments provide the tools for governments to be able to do this to their citizens.
But the Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago was found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a criminal case -- it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The Internet connection.
They were able to get tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see media, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I don't have anything that <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's actually the privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to do today, will be forever.
Do you learn in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no <unk> in the highest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, they go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that they killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying are warriors that protect our community and won, and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, from six to the <unk> is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would be afraid.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because it even helped the lions to see the pen away.
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So I went and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come from.
I found out that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the switch and turn the lights out.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
It was all about it.
As you can see, the solar cell burden up battery and battery <unk> the electricity into the little box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see what lions do when they come at night.
<unk> lights and <unk> all the lions to make me think I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have a problem with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animal animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You see the <unk> You can see the bottom -- these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving so much.
And my idea is also used now throughout Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using elephants to get elephants out of the farms.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, President School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying planes and told me that someday I would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer, and pilot when we <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next thing in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close electric power, which is about <unk>
<unk> I know that they were invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take it back once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the <unk> Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to take it on every step that you have to get my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In the school, we took all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> story, but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, are the enemies.
Although I sometimes asked me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public collapse.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we are prepared to die."
He was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking around the train station, I saw a terrible thing I can't erase my memory.
A woman has no life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms by looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine drop into North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during the famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the energy <unk> everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the country countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North <unk> to <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with <unk> kin.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because the North refugees North China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to an awful destiny in North Korea, in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made -- when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had accused me to be <unk> then I would take my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem like that, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, this was a false <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. This was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are seeking asylum.
But many of them may be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although they were <unk> they eventually released after a long international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't get so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> 27 or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans -- not so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all your world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South America.
And I started a new life over again.
<unk> in South Korea was a better challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with pride of mine.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money that sent into my family, and as punishment -- my family was going to be moved to the force to a location from the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it somehow over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by an official police officer.
He asked the identification of all and started to ask them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
And I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did all to liberate my family, and we were so closely, but my family was <unk> in prison at the distance of South Korean embassy from South Korea.
I went and came up with the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a thinking, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would matter to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the ATM <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, you know, a new hope for me and for the <unk> village, when they most <unk>
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> town.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I joined in South Korea, and I joined in South Korea.
But achieving its freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the English language, practice practice.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family still inside, and we sent information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and believe in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Asia.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of food, fast food, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, let's change the name of Southern Southern so that it represents something else, so they changed it to the South Angeles -- as if this is what it really is wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> food, fast <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food meal, the Los Angeles Center, home <unk> home to the <unk> <unk> in the car.
And the funny thing is that the food places to get kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart diseases, in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I emphasize that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the <unk> effects, that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as a <unk> cars.
I think of <unk> <unk> as Starbucks as Starbucks
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a forest forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> <unk> we call a <unk>
This is 45 meters -- it's three me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what I get in bed, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, the Green <unk> <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest.
What we do -- we are a kind of a <unk> group of the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone got stuck.
The city looked at me and on <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I would say, "Come on there?
A court court -- by planting food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's go away."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
<unk> had a written story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on Earth does not look like this?
<unk> a plant to give a thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
Your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up in there, I grew up with my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Just like a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what earth can do, if they let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witness how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that can be done, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
And I remember one time, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> the night and they were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt about watching people that I was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "I don't know people are going to steal your <unk>
So I say, "Oh my God, I don't have to fear that you're going to be <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a bomb shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant with their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people coming from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If they grow tomatoes, will eat <unk>  But if none of this will tell you, if you're not taught how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind people that put them in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're caught. I see the color of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity that we can train these kids who are being supported by their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them in cafes healthy.
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free not sustainable.
What's interesting about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to put people out of the people, getting the kids out of the streets, who know the joy and the honor of growing their own food, by opening markets in farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to do sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners can be <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Would they take their <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some crap to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Prize. Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made out of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you're going <unk> on your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to do roads by asphalt <unk>
Virtual asphalt is a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so the water can go through it, so that all the rainwater is flowing down on the sides and have a road on which it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water.
Noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very glamorous, all the noise -- so it's a very quiet road.
It also has some <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that it can be <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road on the surface of the surface of the surface away.
First of all, a <unk> then several more and more and more, and so forth, and <unk> -- you won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you can be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
Oh.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage is in this stuff.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if you are <unk> they will be <unk> and be separating from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material, so we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool from that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into smaller pieces, and we can mix those little pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of wool wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to get a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heating the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks are moving back to the surface.
I used an oven <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the shows, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We test a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to <unk>
So a piece of road, a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a lane test to try this stuff.
So that was what we did in there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road is going to last several years without damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did a lot of the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life on the surface of the road, even you can double the life on the surface of the road, even you can double a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it acts the repair.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> at my house.
My father was listening to BBC on his little gray radius.
I had a great smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school told me.
I will never forget it.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban had taken away from Afghanistan and illegal <unk> that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to give me my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
School was in a house, more than 100 of us live in a little hall.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we had our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
And occasionally, the school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is.
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan, <unk> where his daughter, my mother went to school and so his father would be <unk>
But my educated mother became mastery.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first one of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated for our life, and I was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> <unk> -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can just leave your house for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, which is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education to pay your education to do.
So you still want to be <unk>
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the age of age, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud of graduate school in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was home from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He wasn't only about my college degree, but it was also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, which I lead to the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have a big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though and even in front of a <unk> opposition.
As <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
And less than a month ago, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> into his village, and they were literally complaining about being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would make it a try.
<unk> already, if you were born, he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for their old <unk>
What I've realized, and this is something that is very often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the most who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been the key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
It turns out that these changes would not make a lot, after retirement in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were going to come up for them, that <unk> I see the future <unk> and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a life of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> would give me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary style <unk>
It has spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution inspired by the mass of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution as well as the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown a little bit of the <unk> the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a six months of a brutal war, and a few losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> of the <unk> and the challenges, I have loved next to many other women, rebuild civil society society, <unk> a <unk> and fair transition toward democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period of 33 years of exile, I went to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we started the <unk> of Women <unk> by the <unk> of women, a movement of women, leaders, in the <unk> to advocate for autonomy <unk> of the woman and our right to our right to be <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policy of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the early choices in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> all the days of violence.
One day I woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day I went on with the news of the American ambassador and the heart attack.
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> abuses of human rights and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made by a <unk> mindset is <unk> more, and it has away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to get rid of the story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as nation, we chose to make the wrong decision.
We don't do good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and candidates. brought peace and reconciliation yet.
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policy of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus more than I needed the election, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female most than needing <unk> representation and <unk>
We need to stop acting as an outrage and call it of anger.
We need to start acting like compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also put the <unk> in practice, instead of <unk> the collaboration in place of competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately needs to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy of the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> which unfolds into the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so as the uterus is completely covering the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is all the existence of existence.
And so it says, "My <unk> is all the stuff."
And so he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They are all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a spooky question that has an immune response.
This is the secrets.
Why was someone going to stay with a man who would be <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, he had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my alma mater, me to the head with a <unk> loaded with bullets of <unk>
The man, when anyone in this world, he put a gun in my head and <unk> it with <unk> more times that I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a harsh <unk> trap <unk> where each year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies that were <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington D.C.
I'm nearly 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, all of the religions, all of the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse -- it only happens in <unk> relationships or <unk> and <unk> or <unk> or said in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find a reason by which, the domestic abuse, it turns out so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who would stick with it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in the age of 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by couples, and <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, rainy night <unk>
He was sitting next to me in the subway in New York and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a university, <unk> <unk> and I worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and funny, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had a little bit of big <unk> like apples and a <unk> wheat, and it looked so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning of it on a <unk>
We started out and loved everything from me, that was ready, that he had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion on helping teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had done before.
And it was why the arts in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving my dreams of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I stopped my job and <unk> and we went together with Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a physical and financial trap. financial and fancy psychological trap.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat to violence to see how it reacts to it.
And this is where these weapons.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where you're supposed to be that <unk> had to be feeling so safe and bought three weapons.
One had in the <unk> of the car.
Another thing underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma to <unk>
I needed it to feel safe.
But those <unk> were actually a message for me and even though I had never raised my hand, my life already was seriously <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical <unk> <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my mother from my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we lived happily forever, because I loved him, and he wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a very <unk> sense for the wedding and the fact that I form a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and I never would make it hurt.
I spent twice the moon of honey.
And the first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he got so hard on the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our <unk> moon went through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> went on, one or twice a week for the next two and a half years for our marriage.
I told me when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassing at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a great company.
So back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to deal with their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> me -- I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we believe the victims, we know something that normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence happen after the victim has put the end to the relationship, after we get it, because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has come back to get married, let's get rid of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system for <unk> the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges to spend time to spend time to spend time to <unk> their mother.
And so we keep asking why they're just not doing?
I was able to go, because of the last <unk> up that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone around the world: the police, my neighbors and my friends and family friends and family and loved full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> victims like headlines -- women -- women are <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also knew that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened and that they would give their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and moms completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I became married with a kind of tender and kind and kind of <unk>
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have never more, would you be a <unk> gun pointing at my head in someone who says I will.
At this moment, they are thinking, <unk> -- that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid dumb stupid people, but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter to her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end up my particular love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> are only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of the <unk> talking about it with your children, your coworkers and family and family.
They <unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to go into consciously, to slow down your climb and show the victims a safe safe.
Together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> secure and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call it Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have a dress --  luckily, I brought back clothes to <unk>
This is the first change in a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of kind of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them now, but we found it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what they think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater over the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover my mind.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much like this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer who told me that I was going back and he was going to get my hair <unk>
Of course, with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, the which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave it means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl, <unk>
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get a role model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made it model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> also that we have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage, that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now show <unk> and maybe there are some lovers in the fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- is -- less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people are always asking me is: Can I be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I would really tell you to each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> or poet, which would be awesome, as you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> of American <unk> or the <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be a model is to say that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's shocking, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model -- because, unlike surgery, <unk> can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you go through your studies, and you have a copy and some jobs on your back, no matter what you want, if you wanted to be chairman of the United States, but you have a <unk> Model Model Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look like <unk>
The next question that people are always doing is if they were all the pictures <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're moving into the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party.
Here I am with my football team and in the V.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're creations of a <unk> group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people and <unk> and get this to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to get money, and they gave me the free <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for power to keep <unk>
<unk> from these privilege for me looks, not as I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their appearance regardless of who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of <unk> teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young people in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
And how many times do I get up, and I <unk>
So when I research for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that they expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and <unk> you will feel very happy and feel so happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe so <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, you know, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair, being a lot more happy?
They have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs -- the brighter hair and clothes more than fashion -- but probably the most insecure women in the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that will retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when they recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have the success and the failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was high enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- and I wasn't myself who <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum of <unk>
In fact, most of them were taken out of a chance.
My story begins when I was in the city of New York to give me a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five birthday.
He gave the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When my daughter was approaching my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> trip and you drive the <unk>
So this is when we started asking the tourists that were going to get us to get it to get the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been able to go with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a girl who was five years old I could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a October of October and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only on physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
Recently, on one of the trips -- we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the rubber store that <unk> small in previous doors.
And I was described to me that I was five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family photos.
I'm always the one that takes out the picture.
Now I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you didn't get <unk> on reaching someone and ask him, get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do you have that bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughs -- like dumb silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with the Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament have not clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species, these 16, 11 face faced high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> they are important, first of all, provide indigenous services to <unk>
They're our natural junk <unk>
We would get the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria they help to absorb the anthrax that they won't be allowed to make it hurt, and caused huge losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous important importance.
They've been associated with old culture culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the cooperation and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the middle and three in Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and <unk> his life to save the <unk> goddess of the United States <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> in the open environment, in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead, or wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are the victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey on the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to wear vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs on <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs has a huge amount of time for <unk> the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds, they do this to the wild.
They're <unk>
In Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a locally locally not to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we <unk>
How can they help? It can become active assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed from opinion because he saw it fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that Italians were good and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we played on the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where I mean, we decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got the seeds of <unk> south of Zambia into this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach local and grow tomatoes and <unk> and <unk> and ...
Of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so they were going to tell them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't have any <unk>  We were amazed that the local -- in such fertile fertile -- there were no agriculture.
And so instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't make anything, we simply said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew up <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato -- in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe -- we were saying to <unk> "Look how easy is the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful and <unk> and red on the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate it all.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only of Italians would make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, did what the Americans, did the <unk> what the Internet did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk> --  -- let's see the waste that I would give you to <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors are Western donors -- we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about harm that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> distributed.
The two words come from the root of the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I am dealing with any of a different culture as if it was my kids, "I want to be a lot."
I am dealing with everyone in a different culture as if it was my <unk>
So the whites in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This is supposed to be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened up this conference put a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to just answer the people just answering people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you will never motivate anyone, but it turns into a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
It will never come to a community with an idea, and they feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we have a place instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for one time, they would be <unk> but not in community smoking.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been identified.
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face <unk> you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the business doctor in the business, that it sets up with you in your house, at the kitchen table in your kitchen table, and that helps it to find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> New York City.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And I got <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 business <unk>
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says Peter <unk> planning is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death of the corporate spirit.
So now we have <unk> rebuilding <unk> not knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you a marker for privacy, it has to be fantastic to help you, and then you're going to come up with mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you more this morning, more this morning, though.
Local <unk> That's what you <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils we are not <unk> fossils we are not <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
We don't have the technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution. The <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a nice story that was a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the year <unk> got together this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wasn't within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> for moving the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> and so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came to <unk> companies, generic companies, <unk> companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. James Ford.
But there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk> service service.
And later you have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company, the largest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to be fantastic, you have to tell with a terrific marketing and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at the <unk> and look at the 100 companies like the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one, none of it was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in the <unk> in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will be <unk> what someone did for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for you, who made it to you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
You can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us who are surrounding us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do I get my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to the <unk>
How do we share more memories from our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for convenience stores so that our communities can reflect on our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
There's a <unk> to the music.  There's a shoot in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one of the most <unk> property properties.
I live close to this house, and I thought about how it could turn it into a <unk> space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and he was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this caused me a profound gratitude for the lived time.
He gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let's try to keep this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to get down the day and forget how important it for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this home house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> Before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> to reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I would like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk> --  Before I died, I want to sit on <unk> on the assembly line.
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people.
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to go again once more."
Before I died, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving to the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and change ourselves.
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit and now have been made in any walls in countries around the world, like assets, South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, is more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that were more power.
If you think about death -- we have to think about <unk>
Our shared spaces can reflect what we care about as individuals and as community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us, not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is <unk> and it's very hot.
Don't speak, but transmits joy better than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
Does it share it <unk> happen what happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color color.
I don't care about the religious differences and focus on this: Never <unk>
When I singing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I didn't even know -- it reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when it came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I was <unk> in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
You don't think <unk>
But most people don't.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what struck my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though you wouldn't consider them inside of it, that only could mean one thing: they were <unk> people and extraordinary.
Now, for those of those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social media, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, so that it would be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause no known <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new person in my life.
When I was a few months, I realized it was different.
<unk> very much.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living in their own world and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I was pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in the room, looking at the machine, looking at the washing machine, looking at the washing machine, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that had <unk>
As I was growing up, it got more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and naive, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish I'd want, they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normal.
The normal thing is about the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means that there is a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and Sam and I would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, you know, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside of it, and honestly, the search for normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what must have been to be <unk> in the country.
Penn State asked me to me, a <unk> teacher who gave me a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> from these students with their great minds and their big books and their great unknown lives.
But when I develop those conversations, I felt what was supposed to have felt when he fell down the hole in the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like I had these conversations with the students surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenges of energy in the environment and health care, between others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as well as scientists have to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
You don't tell us that we study the <unk> but you study the <unk> which are the grid structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same thing as we do stupid things.
On the contrary, as Einstein said that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is using examples, stories and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you present your work, forget about signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk> bullets and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the language of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we provide graphs that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, for all the media, with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor called the 19th century that defined it so much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge -- no matter what you're looking for, no matter or platform, or that, when you won, it gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced <unk>
He was thrown in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and finally had a popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that there might be <unk>
Some wanted to call him <unk> of state and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the People in the United States.
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tested for quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
All the world got tired and <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
And the House of Representatives didn't want Washington to power power.
They didn't want to call him King by if he would do it or his newfound ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more insignificant and <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invented the title. It was already before, but it was just meant to <unk> that we would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> government, but it really was a <unk> title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to take a serious title and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate, not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until I could figure out, the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama is lucky to stay there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> we may not keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the President of President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more of five nuclear warheads to need the largest economy in the world and a <unk> autonomous vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has endowed the title of <unk>
So eventually won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was an uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the five nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try and choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes a lot more the words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 meters under land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is full of heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but mostly that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I lead a cheap light flashlight on the head with this rubber <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that they hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
And my hand <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> I met the control and dropped countless feet in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole in that hole in the risk of that hole without paying reward and, often, dying.
I walked out of that hole and went home but maybe they never will, because they're <unk>
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in 70 countries in six countries and in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the G8 Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to be a <unk>
When we ended up talking to me that I was very sad, I was honestly trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It made me kind of got up the stomach, and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few of them, I considered it my second home.
But this time, they <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during the entire attempt to <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 <unk> today.
And yet, today you can enable entire families to have entire families for generations of <unk>
<unk> slavery generates profits from over 13 billion 13 billion <unk>
Many of them have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without pay, under threat to violence and cannot escape.
Today the slavery operates in the <unk> the goods, produced by slaves have value, but those of them are <unk>
<unk> exists in almost everyone else, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange, formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- <unk> <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> stack in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them on the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> would have to pee out it was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera turned out too hot and stopped it to work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera is getting a lot better than these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was at my hand very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it here."
And it explained very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't citizen that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for his liberation and trusted who was <unk>
As soon as me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children <unk> rocks for miles for <unk> <unk> to the trucks that were hoped to go down.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children who charge and children to their heads with straps <unk> made of clubs, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that slaves are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the entire life.
You have nothing to do with what <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they completely had their homes.
When we hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, they advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously been <unk>
They sort of led me for a few stairs <unk> which would give this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for insulin prostitution.
They have small, private, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to <unk> clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and dirty identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> fear -- and at that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs for where it is.
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no windows and big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we played a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery -- even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire family families in the business of silk.
This is a family painting.
The black hands of the black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and you throw the silk on the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me about her stories.
We don't have <unk> they were told.
We still don't hope, but we could go out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay your job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial Lake in the world.
When we come, I went to have a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families. <unk> families and forced to work with a lot of these boats in the lake, even though they didn't know swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to it was <unk> subject to me that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees in the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like the entire life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it tries to be the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they went back the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the <unk>
<unk> at night and <unk>
And it means that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they are loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a bomb where the <unk> <unk> to the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
We walked down a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
We were asked to do it by a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would go out of the car, and asked the driver to come out quickly.
And then he pointed this path barely visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so that I put the photos of photos on my head as I put it into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer camp, and they were all full of their enslaved.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs and, while they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters of <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have up to 90 feet and these people have got heavy stone bags that will then be transported to another area where they put the rock out to be able to extract the gold.
First of view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer and forth, we see it work on the margin of some less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took it to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, he was able to sell it to the debt of the uncle what force it to be slave in mines.
When I met her, she had worked at 14 years and the spinal cord injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work on night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, to face a possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on <unk>
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we would give testimony of them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these very beautiful people that I have had to meet.
So I hope that these images show a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do this math math and there is a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like management management.
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So today, I'm going to try and tell you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human.
We <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- we'll see it later on.
But the master demand an extraordinary training degree of training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a certain database that well can have a genetic thought.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, at the time, was a <unk> ballet <unk>
In the last few years, it has been much progress in treatment.
But there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in the objective and ultimately the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it is frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers and so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, you never do. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam they could do with themselves.
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is <unk> as a conventional way, for a try, you see, in some sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits sound to speak -- we can imagine as dancers of a ridiculous gesture because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound and all of us have the genes that needed the <unk> for example.
And as they did it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as the Parkinson's -- it affects the <unk> it doesn't affect the <unk>
On the plots of <unk> you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical <unk> Well, both of them are <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests of <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
And it's very low cost and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it comes on a massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the current difficulties of patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for <unk> routine.
With high <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do a mass of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a big scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Women's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or <unk> it can be able to call down a price and put recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we have reached 6 percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all these samples of, say, 10,000 people -- you can say who's healthy and who doesn't it?
What will <unk> from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Right.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> it may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion in the disease of disease.
TR: You have a precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> have done a fantastic work and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we did the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of the 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We <unk> in the dark, in rooms with no windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin still -- we do the impossible to do the impossible -- and we can get rid of the press, all the time, but some of us are actually artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, in 2011, I saw the rest of the world, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was going on in Japan.
Shortly of the time later, an organization where I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response equipment.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of <unk> of nearly 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level of water went over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We take the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave the houses for <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of all the villages around the city for <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As you go from the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the <unk> toilets, the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center will pick up the photos.
And there they had the honor that it would have the honor of that day to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard about the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had been <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
On the other way, that little girl would not have the appearance of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the course of time, they came to be sort of more pictures, and they got more <unk> so it entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we went back to <unk> a neighbor village north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the early oil libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that you put in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour for an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be a <unk>
This <unk> had to draw out almost by hand using a guide to the areas that color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures drop in seawater, covered in bacteria, even with oil, and even with oil, everything along with the step of time I continue to know that by <unk> it was a important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless you were clean up, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had a <unk> <unk>
We have a <unk> of <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos as well as <unk>
As once once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of kind of been lucky to the photos.
I had started <unk> she was the same but stopped realizing that the <unk> even more.
It was also <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face was not able to reconstruct it, we could <unk> the images in a single photo and put the entire picture.
When I picked up their photos shared some of their history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble of the rubble of a very far way away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find his family and know they had all survived.
The day I gave her his photos his younger son his youngest son, <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, something I could look at, something I could remember from the past was not marked on that day in March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined together -- hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority of them became the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families -- hundreds of <unk> photos and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than <unk> 1,000 in equipment and materials -- most of the ink on ink <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A photo is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They're <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take us but the first thing that we would have to look for.
And this was about the project, to restore little pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this gets back to somebody, it was a huge difference in the life of the person that you're getting in.
This project also made a huge difference in the lives of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something larger, to bring something, using their talent for something that don't be thin red models.
To finish up, I would like to read this electronic mail sent him in Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, <unk> around a baby, and I was embarrassed because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mom, and my <unk> daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few of our basic needs -- right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of just one millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that it can create video camera videos from light motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see from the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer. I switch it on and switch it on a <unk> or a second thing -- in a number of <unk> to create a photo pack of photons just a millimeter wide size.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet of a common bullet as a <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the kind of light of light in <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this is happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light moving.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show you what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Most of the photons eventually come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces it inside.
At that time, the waves travel around the table and because of the insights on the top of the bottle, after several pictures, the insights <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we have to go through the same distance and see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, all a year.
It would be a very boring film -- a slow <unk>
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> on the table, the tomato <unk> and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature looks like a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> composition of it.
But if you look at it more and more that they will realize that, as the light becomes <unk> of <unk> it still bright. They don't get <unk>
Why? Because the tomato <unk> is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As a photographers, you know, if we take a photo of <unk> it comes up very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exposure -- so I just got some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, million times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> very interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can get invisible, they can become invisible,
And if a new power of a superhero would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could get those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in moments slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique resources.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what extent to that distance.
So when we project a laser here can record a photo in <unk> which you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the symmetrical object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our rebuilding here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on the curve, around it.
Or we could look for survivors at dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> which can be able to see the inside of the body with the <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood -- this is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> like a new measure of visualization to solve the problems of mammography discussion in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, became the science of art, an art of <unk>
I realized that all of the <unk> of data that we collected every time is not just for scientific ideas, but we can see that we can see it.
We create a new form of computer photograph with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves, you remember the time between each one of those waves -- it's just a few <unk> of a second.
But this is also a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move toward us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. At Einstein that would have delighted to see this image.
The order that the events occur in the world sometimes is invested in the camera.
We have to get the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone -- a <unk> crime in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song -- <unk> to <unk> and make a famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people would come in search for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. You can imagine if all these people would come up with a change, you have a change in your pocket.
Who from the exhibiting have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Put your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, <unk>
It's a lot. Almost all of you have a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how life changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Bad data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Library of the E.U. filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This message says that every European telephone company, every single city provider in the entire Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends him a text <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years in his telephone company or your phone provider or the Internet car.
And across Europe and he stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, <unk> priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Germany <unk>
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please do was <unk> all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a court lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, you have a agreement.
<unk> the demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a <unk> inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> <unk> 30 lines of information.
At first I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step out, what I'm doing.
But then I said, <unk> <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention data means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going on on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me to talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then you call each other, and the other one to another, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate each other to what time they call each other, and what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks with who, who sends an email to who, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, it would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk> <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and business agencies want to store as much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home and tell their friends that privacy is a 21st century, and it's not in fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that just because business and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information is to store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that are going to give them to remember that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
My name's <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain cerebral palsy, so let's get it all the time.
Have a look.
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it's not <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a <unk> and I don't want any of you to come out there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, we wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> at Christmas, are at the shopping center, driving circles, looking for parking circles, and what do you see?
16 empty empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Moreover, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian <unk> woman, wife, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do that.
I'm from "Jurassic <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three <unk> sisters would <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents went to the school system, my parents went to the school system, and they would convince them that I was out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate <unk> all my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five to put my <unk> in his feet and just walking around.
Another tactic that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that we had it.
The <unk> which I carry inside was very strong.
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a prosthetic champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they keep all of the family --  I think nobody realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
The people who grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed like a lot of <unk> a lot to die during the <unk>
I would tell you that he had enough fat fat to live three months without eating up, so I noticed the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I learned to walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to be <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> all the <unk> were <unk>
On the summer vacation and often my father was trying to <unk> so I drank milk from <unk> and put me up on the <unk> Sea <unk> in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the miraculous cure was the yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before doing yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents -- this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital was <unk>
I went to college by the <unk> and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because it would go in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet the entire theater.
I was all <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least <unk> I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classrooms.
Every time I was doing a scene of the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a piece called <unk> very slow in <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "He will have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of <unk>
Thanks to God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater, in theater, crying out historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't make the risk stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunt stunts either.
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without the cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
Al <unk> came home, and my first tour <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream was true.
And I knew that would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, he stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> directors didn't have the white <unk> <unk> <unk> with disability.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I did <unk>
On my first tour, he took comics -- famous from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he was at high speed of the New Jersey highway, with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and we find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival in New York City, now in its 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in the media, and sometimes remind the directors of how I want to <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of <unk>
My great opportunity arrived in 2010.
I was like invited to the cable news program, it has Keith <unk>
I walked into a college dance, I went back to a studio and sat down to a <unk> and sat in a wheelchair.
And I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I grabbed the desk desk to not go out of the screen for the <unk> and when I ended the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have having me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like <unk> full-time and taped my chair.
And something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never hurt me, no longer as a little girl or <unk>
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips on the line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does it have?
We really should be pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual or race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make a <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors would say not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
But we have grown up with media media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we could create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet on the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world -- Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give kids refugees refugees.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I devote this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
My name's <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> in Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there is no work, no more perspectives of the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he gives him a guy who offers him to take it back to dinner, after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
It gets a little bit of money so you buy new clothes, money to send your family home.
They presented to a young man.
Finally was home.
It starts a new life.
It has a living goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts out a bomb.
That child from that little village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> an unhealthy connected organization to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came on.
This was the first thing that he pulled him out of what we call the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity opportunity, but the young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they didn't give them opportunities, the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, violence to violence -- to be the history of sustainable cities.
And in my city of birth, they <unk> 70 percent of the young men is <unk>
70 percent don't work, not at school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit <unk> Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, "Well, if I had never gone?
And if I had seen forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have turned into <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few young leaders in a corporate signal.
<unk> to about 90 leaders juveniles <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because I was because it was a college student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other ethnic organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point B is the street.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company from <unk>
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who usually couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
So why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think the ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
It empowers young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be <unk>
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how it will be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic plastic from overseas.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said they could survive hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding in the houses, and the business companies and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and, as he says, let's smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he has no <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs work for the government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
You encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> from change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and creating a corporate spirit culture, is really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in the development and put it out of their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources they need, <unk> support that need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, corporate spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
His <unk> is how it calls it when it is created, when it is created, and transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
They gave them the chance to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to make young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their innovation -- and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in the middle of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves as a <unk> and it will not be on the way that we were able to, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings on to step on that ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake lake when I discovered something nasty.
Behind the shed had a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of paper <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they had <unk> who thought it was going to clean their <unk>
That question kept with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
It doesn't matter as <unk> or where you get the <unk> who clean our trash <unk>
Who clean our crap in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our trash -- the reason for 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products -- every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities throughout the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more <unk>
So I started working like garbage <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling at the trucks. I <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
You all ask about the smell.
It is there, but it's not as intentional as you think, and in the days that it's very strong -- you can get away quickly.
It takes a lot to get used to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and pass <unk> around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And the garbage is also full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage to it.
I also learned about the relentless of crap.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a breathing form or circulation.
It always has to be in motion.
And it's the stigma.
It seems like stigma is especially ironic because I believe that waste waste is the most important labor labor in the city streets, for three reasons.
They are the first guardians of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective form every single day, this starts to <unk> it from its <unk> and their dangers are <unk> you in very real ways.
We had been controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old old way, we don't have space for what the motors in the economy begin to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just turn your relationship.
And then what I call our average speed is necessary.
I mean by the speed that I mean by moving in the little contemporary time.
Usually we didn't get <unk> or <unk> or we have our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that it takes to do that.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste of waste that may help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design an sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us except for ourselves, of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always have to stay one way or another.
One day after the 11th of September 11, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste on the street, grabbed my little child, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his paper recycling route as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her work that day in particular, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that I began to investigate the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> We work together so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist in this planet as the species we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost.
<unk> waste what we think when we're talking about garbage represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you can see someone whose job is to clean the crap of you, take a moment for <unk>
Let's have a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born of the conditions and local traditions.
So today I brought two recent projects here as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis analysis becomes an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall to design a mall in Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After looking at some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the cladding of <unk> generates heat in the interior, so that you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it comes to a sea climate that's going from 20 to 25 degrees over the entire year.
And third, it has nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to the open air, where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space for generating external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building modern building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey the site, which is located in a very low-cost area in the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a hundred feet of a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, linking all the entries in the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> which creates an open air space in the building that would be absorbed by its own form, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would go to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air input and the light, but in a <unk> way.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by a building in the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because in order to account there was more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was so much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning out.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city where electricity is <unk> almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with <unk> and bars that would create this urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which we set up with water for inner <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth ground floor.
The second example is a master master plan, and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a very big project, the greatest that I have designed for, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, and their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the <unk> a thousand years of ancient ancient that he was surrounded by a combined wall with 12 doors of access to the straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first piece of design that we did was broaden the streets in the existing streets, creating 12 similar building blocks in size and features to those in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points in relation to the idea of <unk> <unk> with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was thinking about the cell, the little cell cell -- like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and so much natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a framework that claims that most apartment is perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant, we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up higher density at higher levels and lower density in the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving to the community that the space occupied by construction.
It is where all the neighbors, you can upload it and make a activities like running a <unk> race for the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people change the communities and the local economies in the same pace that grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment that have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great amounts of hair, very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> was super hard for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I had my sinister plan.
One day I had a time after the <unk> was a little late and I hid in the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt went into the classroom, I took the table of my master's at the book of grades.
And then, I did.
I put the ratings on my <unk> just a little bit, just some of this.
All the way --  And I set up with the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other fellows had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a line of it, just to be there, because they <unk>
I'm still surprising what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I didn't understand why I was never <unk>
It was that it was all obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I would give me the reason why I was bothered by this little girl, so small, it was so good for <unk>
I <unk> jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that looked at loneliness, or the long duration or the length duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in the lab when you study <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be not literature.
I would not have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no <unk> King or <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I went to the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> there would be no <unk> or <unk> We would not have <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as the <unk> <unk>
This year is a hundred years of his masterpiece, "In <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so good together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious like the <unk> that reduce the person, to their desire, their <unk> are a very <unk> <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being the <unk> and <unk> we know exactly what details that you would say, <unk> to <unk> the knife right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that is something that I understood.
All she does to give me pleasure back to me and give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm cool thing that <unk> senses in his lover -- he adds up his collection of instruments of torture on your private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> is <unk>
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big amounts of hair, bright hair, the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links with the <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> <unk> you hear behind the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- so the <unk> those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different about the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with true value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look at <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth -- the more painful the truth.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these were the pathways toward the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs -- that makes us suffer, it causes us a range of feelings that is much more profound and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
We're saying we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think he's trying to say that <unk> will reveal us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us open it in this very particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about it later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man, which was consumed with the idea that his woman would be <unk>
And Freud says that there was a little strange in that man, that he didn't stand up in what his wife was.
So she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was looking for his wife, without realizing <unk>
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud say that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> pretty well how <unk> make us look at intensity but accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are, more we turn us into <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal acts.
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking of myself -- I think about eight years ago, I would say, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since the first ones sent <unk> <unk> to itself, for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big do you have creativity, right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia Schroeder
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to do the <unk> of our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to <unk> your self and <unk> what you ever <unk> and it's under the ground floor, you have your name, empty bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as well as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> shows us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> of <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs <unk> genius.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it will be <unk> and <unk> it in each one of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something started to change, and eventually on "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they <unk> you come in, you go back to the solution, and it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And it tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems like <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a <unk> minute of the opposite of <unk>
At the next minute of the next side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It might be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a subject of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction fiction, jealousy.
fiction used to <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet candy -- the terrifying thing Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of January, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Princeton <unk> from Apollo 11, and went on the sea Sea <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on gray gray surface, was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program, was the highest succeeded in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a couple of 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on its surface, which is that <unk> after Armstrong death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds.
Why <unk> The <unk> answer is that the <unk> President wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words in the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> -- some people ask, why do we <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why do Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West in the Cold War.
At the time, the most strong emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great power to do that.
And the landing on the moon came up in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and just removed smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew 15 miles over hour.
Since the 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has evaporated into the power of technology has evaporated to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or power to the world population, seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't go to the <unk> escape from the rocket Saturn V.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have distracted us and have enriched toys with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we didn't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that they have created less ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years that are <unk> meaning, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically the incentives that venture capitalists provide the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their peak point of <unk> not worry about the risk, they preferred tiny investment, lower investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and that development is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to fix the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems are fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price do not exist.
Now, technologists, officials and economists agree about what political and international treaties -- developing energy development development, which is a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of the political climate that we'll see an energy policy or the United States, which reflects that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem to be technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from the time that famines are the result of failure in the supply thing.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affects <unk> the food distribution.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The <unk> president -- that was the war on cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some extraordinarily resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found effective treatments and effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can have and must, but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders, and the population must want to solve the problem: the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it holds with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be easy.
He was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to begin with <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> from our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a major decrease of trust, is a very widespread belief.
The second is a <unk> we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
So what I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, the <unk> why do people think of trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I make it bow to think that there may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have risen on others.
I don't have that.
But I can turn to opinion surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion surveys over time, there are not a lot of evidence.
I mean, the people who have been <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politics, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> they are nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway through.
But is this evidence for enough?
What surveys of opinion departments are, of course, opinions.
What else can you say?
What you see are <unk> attitudes, that people care about when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I would probably say, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when they had answered your question, "Well, I trust it, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to make trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> officer or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain masterpiece of elementary school that I know to give the reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more unequal way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence in the real trust, because they try to make the good judgment of inherent in fact to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I <unk>
I would be able to have more confidence in what is trusted and trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what it is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were able to raise their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, you say, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters first is not trust, but the trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to make a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw materials, and it's responsible and I mean, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't belong on them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see it <unk> your own <unk>
And I'm so happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still have no <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to do before we trust.
Trust is the answer.
The one is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the system of accountability that is meant to guarantee the top and testing tests actually is making the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
You may all know the similar examples.
Let's get all that, for the goal.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we want to think about being worthy of trust, and we will tell the people that we are trustworthy and if we want to figure out whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what it doesn't do <unk>
Third, the task.
We went to the task to rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve our confidence.
But the trust, ultimately is accurate, because they give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough of the foundation enough to be trusted.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all the people, all the time.
But you also have to bring <unk> evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do it?
So that does a day, everywhere, it makes the common people, <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says that I can <unk> it without giving the explanations of it.
I take it back and get it back money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great -- I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're looking at is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination is <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was not <unk>
I started imagining what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that is <unk> in the digital space so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break down the booms.
But the two hands still stay out of the screen.
How do you go inside and interact with digital information using the entire dexterity of your hands?
In the <unk> <unk> division with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They <unk> a transparent bombsight with the chambers of depth to detect the fingers and your face, you can now pick up the keyboard, in the keyboard, you can get inside of the three-dimensional space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and you try and emphasize <unk> or words with the virtual touch sensor that there's the bottom of every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with our hands.
In these examples, we are feeding on the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We had a lot of us to have bought and put things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
So what I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physicists so that we can be physicists so we could <unk> and <unk>
How would a future this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel <unk>
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did is we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And when I program digitally promotes the object, we released it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and they will be reproduce and they have to reproduce the physical world.
You can teach it physically and at the distance, and the famous <unk> of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality, the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks. This is a real experience and felt that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the computer physics is to imagine how programming the world is going to change our physical activities today.
As you can see, digital information is not only going to show you something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without we have to get rid of our world.
We started the talk of today talking about a barrier, but if you look at that barrier, the only limit that remains our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
Then of surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was only an inherent path to the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
It doesn't matter if I do work or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera singer
This was me in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could do to go to the opera school.
I wrote to the law director and the host of a radio.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
I just got my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
It would argue that for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me I wanted to <unk> Okay.
Let's go into the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but a strange thing.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
I told me, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> guilt and <unk> the relationship with my parents.
And I find it with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
It was a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China should learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it as well in <unk> life.
So I started reading books on two.
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of getting lost in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
My books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to get back or powerless before.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
And a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in psychology at Berkeley.
She was a 26 year-old woman named Alex.
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on my office couch, took my shoes and told me I wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could deal with it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought in the sessions, made me easy to just move your head while we had the solution.
<unk> is the new <unk> he was like, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start working on, and you start working later, she has children later, until the death is after.
And for <unk> like Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex to talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with the guys under his category, and it was <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like being married with him."
And then my squad squad <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe it was <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk>
It was when I realized that <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This caused the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of the <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think no one gets to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Ah, Yes! It's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away the dream of a <unk> I want to see -- it's okay. So the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years.
This means that eight in 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- that they give their life a way to have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> I didn't panic to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, and they are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that wants to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to his top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years is crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> names, names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> what is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard Cohen, said that for great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give you a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, every day, who are smart, interesting as you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts going on something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the play of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point about 30, it crashed the music and everyone started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's an enormous pressure to the 30 and so many of us starting a career, pick up a city, pick a couple, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are some research that starts to show you, which is much harder and stressful to do all of the <unk>
The middle <unk> crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having a identity.
He said you would like to work in art or the entertainment or the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, it was living with a boyfriend, who was a more <unk> than ambition.
And even though they live a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our sessions, but then she woke up her same when she said, "One doesn't pick your family, but he can choose to pick your friends."
Well, one day she was Emma put his head on his legs and he cried for almost every hour.
I had had to buy a new notebook for <unk> and had spent the whole morning, but he had a lot of <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after words "In case <unk> please call <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if it gives me <unk>
At that point, it really cost me a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the <unk> <unk>
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> of that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
And for identity, I mean doing something to add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital of identity generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to give you a try.
I'm not <unk>
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I was doing jobs and to do it count.
Second, I said to Emma the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you in the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds just just like who you know what you know, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who will go out almost always come from the outside circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak bonds of friends of their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the form of <unk> to this group.
And half of the jobs that are never <unk> then to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma would soon give her family when she has a mate and it has a partner and form his own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit down, that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook start walking toward the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you get it, and that means being as intentional in love as you are in the workplace.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to make it work or killing time with anyone to be <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> of a cousin who worked in an art museum who worked in a art museum who worked in the other state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That work supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who I live with.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, love his new family, and I sent me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of guidance are not <unk>
<unk> story may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like planes coming out from the Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, about 21 or the age of 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good deal of break, a good TED Talk can have huge effect on the next few years, or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> who know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
This is what I have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma all <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get an identity of identity, use their weak ties.
Don't stop define what they didn't know or what they didn't have.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management of a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to <unk> <unk> in New York schools.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I work back, I would have grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones that had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and was really convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk>
And we're trying to predict what to happen to <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied teachers who are working on really difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, and ask yourself, what about these sellers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, not the <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a <unk>
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my determination to determination and then waited for about a year to see those who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly likely to graduation, even when they were <unk> in every single characteristic that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of the evidence that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the <unk> National <unk> which matters <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know, how little science does about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you development focus on the children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination often is not related or even related to how much talent matters.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> of growth."
This is an idea that developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not accurate, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions -- and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to fail, to start all of the new things with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was obsessed with this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I have been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single character in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese scholar <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
So today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to go for a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, like I was shouting at the <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> the shape of it, but I like to believe that it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of <unk> in the old West <unk>
I call this eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
A person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person checking your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a rope as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  <unk> to remember, because a loudspeaker tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two up together, it's very hot.
Three up together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've already happened for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters to build other 32.
So with every little effort, they will be able to learn a pair of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started making sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the Sun.
This is a sun placed with the <unk> because Japan is in this China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two stacked mountains one about the other.
In ancient China, it meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their own political enemies out of the mountains.
Today, the exile is turned out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the Wizard of Oz together.
The film came over his imagination, for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic bullet.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex from <unk> <unk>
However, the Oz magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later, later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> <unk> a guy whose <unk> a metal kid and a <unk> kid would go into a girl dresses like the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the Wizard of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think that if the Oz magician is doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
Do you do magic shoes to defeat the armies made by the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Wizard of Oz is that the most <unk> elders and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing that when I did Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Within three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had been <unk>  So she was so slid in the room and was impressed like a mother leg with her <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> resilience and <unk>
Would the sense that Luke got an army to overthrowing government?
<unk> this with the Oz <unk>
How does Dorothy her film?
We do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world in which I want my children to grow up, and it's not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much efficient capital force in movies for our kids, and so little of the way of <unk> bricks and <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
Now, I know the experience that the princess <unk> does not give it the proper framework that I had served to navigate the world of adults who was <unk>  I think that at the time of the first breakthrough I was hoping that the credit started to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why do they stand there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to stand up to the Disney War to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they were, the boys are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend their <unk> but they don't necessarily show the boys how they defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of every time continues to appear on classic <unk> every single one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and your son, or two men who bred a young girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, it was finally thinking about it.
I recommend everyone is already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when it came <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It still has no root and <unk> but maybe we will start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of a friend about the assessment of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there are more women who have lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the guy who <unk>   Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who have and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> a consensus idea of what is a quality of quality.
<unk> doesn't happen the <unk> test.
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie -- I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men that have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go into the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 <unk> movies how many of them believe they have <unk> protagonists of them.
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then is okay.
But there is a larger number than this guy who is going to go through this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it was.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the <unk> of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistic, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools for our willingness as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> will <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our boys a new definition of <unk>
The definition of box, is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character of Star Wars you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dressed itself.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories to tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where it looked at their work is join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I became <unk>
I started looking at shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of past and <unk>
And eventually when I started studying <unk> I realized that I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up at almost 1.3 miles of length by the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see a different way.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see about using the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern pajamas. of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in place, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process using color fake and suddenly the place looks like bright yellow.
What you're looking at is the actual chemical changes of the landscape of the construction materials and the <unk> of the old Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of the ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous continuous <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles away.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, I moved on this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> <unk>
And I'll try to find that by the random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we used NASA <unk> data to make a place of place, very subtle changes.
We could be able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this tiny area that you see within the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots take on the ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we are looking for the layers of human occupation for human occupation for human occupation for human occupation for human occupation for human interfaces.
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location -- five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of many hundred years that date from the Ottoman Empire -- exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> works of <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem like it's not too much, but when we think about the most common rocks they used in the jewelry, of the Middle Empire -- these are the rocks <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence for an elite jewelry, which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find a <unk> here, but we would go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And most importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire. I was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is most of the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So as I think, TED was not founded in 1984 A.D., C.
They have really begun in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now let's go through a group of <unk> obese <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> career of bicycles and go to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They stand up against the door of your house.
You have bikes flying everywhere, so they go on their side, the one of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- <unk> the threshold of the gate, <unk>
You go back into the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse you talk about.
You can feel your blue fur, turning on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go out to get into the mouth.
You go on the side and enter your living room.
In the room, and making peak of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes and dancing over their downtown, singing <unk> I <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow bricks and from the oven coming into you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, this is like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of the different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just once.
We had the names of tens and tens of strangers.
We put whole poems in only minutes.
<unk> to see who she could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be the phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
And I asked her, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques invented that was invented two and a half thousand years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used to use <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that the Medieval academics were used to memorize children's books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How do I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English person, although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order on a deck of play, live in national T.V.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
Or do you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending the most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential is.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went on a late afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And when he comes back, I read a lot of treaties on the architecture written by something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not such a weird thing as you might find it today.
A long time, people put in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but also have changed.
They have changed, and I would argue that they've changed our cognitive minds.
As we almost don't have need to remember, sometimes we have to forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet is where people are really passionate about this idea of <unk> memory and <unk> and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there is <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know -- I'll be able to have brains in some kind of structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> battery and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects that we <unk>
When they put them on an MRI MRI MRI machine, <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow -- they found that on the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves space memory and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament of the competitive <unk> is running as an armed career where every year comes someone with a new way of remembering more things, faster and then the rest of competitors have to put up a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times the memory.
On your desk, in front of him, there are 36 percent of playing playing -- he is about trying to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the order of <unk> <unk>
half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the end, you reduce a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people who remember the same word -- I say to you, you know, there's a man called <unk>
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I come back later back later, I ask you about that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their job is <unk>
The same word, different ability to <unk> that is rare.
What happens here?
Well, the name is, actually doesn't mean nothing to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
And all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have <unk>
They were going home when they come home to work.
You probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some given time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this about two and a half thousand years ago, in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> who did a <unk>
They had hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring it to a <unk> he was <unk> to a poet.
He stood up, he stood up his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> room was <unk>
They went to everyone.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
And so you couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped outside, only survivor, in the rubble, I closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single <unk>
I took the <unk> hand where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What you <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we are not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have memory and spatial memory.
If I would tell you that the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to get them very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to tell you who I was sitting on the brown yellow horse in your lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to do it out of memory, the same way I would have done it, if they had done it for <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous idea: crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then I went back in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
So this is like the <unk> <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for word -- which is going to confuse but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The <unk> sentence was like the first place in his palace of memory.
And I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck in that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
And really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting sitting on <unk> I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone was left off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was a entertaining.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it is actually about doing is to improve increasingly the ability to create and imagine these iconic images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a pair of <unk> and a pair of security axes with tape leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor
I ended up coming back to the same competition that had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could go in, in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment was out of control.
And I won the <unk> which I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's lovely power and <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to put up the <unk> of the memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
It turns out when we focus deeply into it.
The palace of memory, these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of full care kind of attention that most of them is not <unk> over there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk around our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even know about it in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the guy who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we would have just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And then everybody passed the time watching television -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I went back, and I was going back in one towel that I would all be seen.
And I was like this.
It was attacked, and it hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, or <unk> division of areas, but of those connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it so that it was based on a building that was built and a half a half a half a half two years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> which uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very helpful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know that they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library -- which ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> he has this clean thing, and <unk> brick -- that they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the values of the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other side of the country, was turned like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, be so different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so that we get away from the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go on the other side and go back with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experiment with <unk> we do <unk> the next to go ahead, and over and over and over and over and over again, so we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course it is in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago that the 1970s.
The architects were busy creating the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
It really hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to bring those symbols into these symbols.
We would have the pendulum next in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add a bake and we use a little new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The forms was <unk> they won at boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic fantasies in the suburbs, and we can make our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
You may have an infinite number of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we measure memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum next in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> symbols now with new <unk> design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> some shapes that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum next to us in the opposite direction.
But then something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics critical and public <unk> were completely agree on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up on a 2,500 percent when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland,
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these forms and wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media went around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing made the main mayors in the world.
So everyone believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new billion country was with other architects star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of new millennium, actually started to happen with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of how we eat architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, all of us are photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before we knew if which I designed four years ago was an success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we have buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen to happen, because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or an elevator.
My theory is that when you apply the media, and the media, it starts to be <unk> faster and faster, to get to be on both extremes and almost <unk> and really <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, the architects, and you, the audience.
Now we can make almost <unk> symbols with something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked at the exact product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made out of the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet <unk> for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded by examples of innovation, what can a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell you that there is no response only to what a library is today.
Let's be a part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and you're not a <unk> audience who doesn't embrace something that doesn't have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum is going to come from a style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the extent of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas of what it must be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will <unk> the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage garage garage, can also serve for sports or <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Side of New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, is not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion as <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we do.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent buildings and more kind.
We have been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there is a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give them a way to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we shape our kids, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And what makes that cool way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
It's laughing and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do this, and he asked me to think about doing this?
How is it that we suddenly are <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenagers, it just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom says it all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among the stuff that his mom says and what his friends, or fellow colleagues say, don't know who I believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and ask others who please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty good or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager, which gets these answers to one of the most vulnerable stages of their most vulnerable vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never ends.
Never before we've been so connected in a continuous way, so young as young people.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his fourth <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that is <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is manipulated <unk>
What is the most prominent thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what the young people do.
But the boys are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of sports stars, and the singers are <unk>
But what is the problem with all of this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow up and be healthy individuals.
But in a culture that is obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as we taxpayers and the labor developing field.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class.
One in five are not attending at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you look at good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- you have a lower note of the average of your companions who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it comes regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be quite clear, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
<unk> over your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, engage in more diet that can lead to a food disorder, you can bring it to a food disorder, you can bring them to a food disorder, you can bring them to a food disorder, you can bring them to a food disorder, you can bring it to a food disorder, you can bring
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what they make more <unk> choices like alcohol and drug consumption and drugs, <unk> surgery, aesthetics, sexual relationships, early and no protection and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what was that <unk>
<unk> this potential is a interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about it, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first one is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the perfect images of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs really <unk> without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to make anyone willing to provide an education education that would work.
A education is a fundamental education, but to deal with this problem requires each one of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
Tell the status of the current status of how women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of an Olympic athlete on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
We all can start by doing that by taking responsibility for the type of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we need to work together like communities, like governments and like companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow their entire person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put the people that really make a difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe they have never seen the <unk> of being those who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who has on mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
His <unk>
It could be just the woman who is on two seats. What would it mean for her, if he was liberated from that voice to be liberated in his interior, who was <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her, if we did this, and we would empower his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is <unk> all of us.
But let's give our kids the truth.
It turns out that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for the ones who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
<unk> to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we work together as a community from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of today, become safe change agents in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially it was innocent. but being a prisoner for other charges -- and in the company of others, they started planning attacks for about 12 of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans was <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the 1993 bomb, in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, they would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer, engineer, with an American mom who had an American mom, high school school high school school made all the possible for giving me happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
So I saw that when people take time for <unk> it doesn't require a lot to be able to get the same stuff in life.
However, in all of religion, in every human group, always there is a tiny fraction of people who have been committed to their convictions who thinks you have to use all the means for everybody to live like them.
A few months before arrest him, he sat with me and explained to me that in the weekends, he was explained to me that in the weekends, he and some friends, had been going to run in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little orange light on the goal and for surprise of all, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned into others, and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As father, such a son.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they thought about so funny.
You saw the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to put a loaded with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to me 20 times, that instability for my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was a moment of packing and moving to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class I often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white <unk> but it will be the new of the quiet class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going home reading books, watching books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to put it <unk> to grow under <unk> it wasn't ready for the real world.
And I was raised opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the test of thinking, was it for the presidential elections, in 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention in the <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> on the subject of juvenile violence as I had been the victim of <unk> almost my life, was something that I felt very much passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done, friendship, was protected.
And I took a few days to go out of light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of being able to overcome the barrier that the whole life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
My whole life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critical critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people exactly the way I wish to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that would be homosexual but I do know what is being <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart asked me to be honest with my <unk> and I was helping me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he turned into my <unk> figure at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
The inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all of that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to take the violence to be able to hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I went to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism and the victims of the <unk> to speak up against those meaningless acts like rejection of my father's actions.
With this simplicity -- I put myself here as a proof that violence is not an inherent or any religion -- that children don't have to follow the roads in their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this moment, there is a film that projects in their minds.
This is an incredible movie.
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that we project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie with you, you and you and you.
There is nothing to be involved in more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I don't have sure that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why aren't we just robots that are going to be able to do what we get to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Now, science by nature, is objective it.
consciousness, by nature, is <unk>
Then there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would take that vision.
psychology is true of true behavior -- neuroscience is not studying the true brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for the science -- the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of fantastic work that I've introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a rocket science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience is answers some questions that we want to explain to consciousness -- questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
So it doesn't address the true central mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The usual <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how the <unk> work, how the <unk> work, and how the <unk> are adapted and <unk> the living organisms, all of them are questions about the goal.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk, how we speak, how we are playing <unk> they are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard standard of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works for a long time, and I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I came to the conclusion that that wasn't working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a beautiful explanations chain, pretty cool. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific worldview.
I think that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know we still know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy ideas, before we can deal with awareness of a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective film, it includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain functions, functions, human behaviors, and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that you get in, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe like fundamental bricks and space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and properties are not explaining in the most basic terms.
Rather, they look like principles, and it is in the world in the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that they can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time laws and then <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that these laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, <unk> charge, then for a matter of logic -- there's a <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental brick of the wild.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden it's not the object of science.
It turns out that it opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, the space, the time, the mass of physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want to do fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, every mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anxiety when you think "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of nasty feeling <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anybody think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing.
<unk> of <unk> complex, as in a human being, very complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
One very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And I am not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse -- there is an average degree of information, but as much significant, of consciousness matters.
But when you get into the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of a different awareness of zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It will take the structure of reality, using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have quite serious social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have anything to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral moral, is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is, if it's conscious.
If this is right now, they are very serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of the intelligent computers development systems and the <unk> ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk. We have a collective consciousness -- an internal movie for this full TED group, for this full TED group, from the internal movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing to be universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way toward a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we will ultimately be discovered.
Understanding the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village to Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was excited about my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a obvious problem.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a very low-cost in my mom, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Many years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a <unk> high school teaching just after about 20 minutes in the MIT class, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
I said, "What do you say?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs. They talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability as <unk> objects.
And we don't are, and it's not <unk> <unk> -- that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to our relationship to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you really remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we could spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this one: "The only disability in life is bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with a carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> inspiration.
And use the term porn term -- since I went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would have the disability on the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad who is my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that they believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my job had a public profile.
It was like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will lead to people with disability on the benefit of people without disability.
You're there so that you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's get a few things.
But the things we spend is not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> I would deliberately use it because I was called the social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the ordinary.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because you've sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And I honestly don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not in times inspired by anything?"
And I really know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all times.
However, I don't know that I am more lucky than them.
You know, it's a great idea to use a great idea to use a <unk> of <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to upload the battery of the mobile phone battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance in others, not against our bodies and our diagnostics, but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that you've been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles, in the stairs is not made that it becomes a <unk>
Never.    <unk> on a television screen will not make the <unk> for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching the <unk> <unk> not considered to be considered nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we have to get up in the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a <unk> kid in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
disability does not make us <unk> but question what you think about to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today, just answering one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think really <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because the augmented reality will change our lives as well as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> the Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game field for 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
And we can know that a man of 110 pounds would get rid of it, trying to be <unk> with all of its being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's nothing nice.
So let's take some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the field, but it has nothing to do with being on the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> and you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God. Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man in a Russian roller coaster of his life.
What will the experience of a fan is when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan experience.
When I could be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball of the network?
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers of adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk> <unk>
<unk> the augmented reality when the <unk> and the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to gain. You give them money.
So, here's a quick review of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> they put a <unk> into their field <unk> so they would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to be <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put into the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player going back to your group and see their next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have put in, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or a <unk>
You just go into the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
So how do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that is down.
You can also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones have information <unk>
This is going to give the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being for <unk>
It will be also <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the field.
It would be the ball and <unk>
<unk> on an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to kill you, not <unk> but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It will be the area of protection.
Another <unk> will be <unk> that there's an open wind.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land. However, the receptor sees it in its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights and can modify the race.
And the <unk> catching the <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
Let's use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad it is from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology worth a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we make, the choices we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as usual, from us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was given to me the end of the southern tip of <unk> County, which includes the <unk> bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and his <unk> style <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The bridge <unk> had been open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who had a goal of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its opening and more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you out of all your concerns and pain, and the water that go underneath them, your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used for suicide.
After a <unk> of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is <unk> the bones, some of which we put in vital organs.
Most of them die in an impact.
Those who don't know, they usually fall into the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think the ones that we <unk> this suicide method will be aware of the <unk> death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel into the bridge.
This is where most people are before they had their life.
I can tell you the experience that once the person is on that edge, and in your darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this photo last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you the joy that we had success that day I would bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
It was going to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those of us who were going to get the suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at <unk> 22, last year when they got a call of a potential subject for a suicide bomber sitting in the vehicle near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to Jason talking to a <unk> bridge officer.
Jason was just 32 years old, and it had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to here twice as long before New Jersey to try and <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked the story about the history of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could more and she opened up the box.
And she came out of it, <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
It stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he was gone.
This kind of intelligent New Jersey of New Jersey had just taken life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I suppose when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
Parents of Jason had asked it.
<unk> damage is a lot of people affecting a lot of people.
So I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was suicide <unk>
What do you find?
What do you say?
In my experience, there is not just to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
You don't mean <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like it feels because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't have to be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be able to believe -- <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to <unk> <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go down the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
He never came there.
I called the <unk> police and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the Apple car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before no longer to suffer a real <unk>
It should not be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge, and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, of 2005, I replied a radio call by a potential subject by a drone subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I took my motorcycle on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and the next, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back on that lane and give the life another chance.
When Kevin turned on, he <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he make it <unk> and you gave the hope and the other <unk> life.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from talent and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing to erase the events of 11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin keeps with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as the name is.
We thank God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her writing, <unk> when I visited General <unk> Hospital that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I knew I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It speaks to the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk>
That act, even though they end up their own pain, including the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Out of those incidents that I've been directly involved involved, I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I was holding my hand at three times.
At the end of the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those guys who have jumped from the bridge, and we lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must work to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inner world, you know what you are, and a question will tell you, "How do you become that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that had had since a little girl.
My outside was finally <unk> with my inner truth, with me.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture -- I think we managed to get this photo <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm getting started.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations by the color of your skin or for the beliefs that surround us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo what is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- a lot of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I recorded myself as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why do you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I was never allowed to share my story, not because I thought to be what I'm wrong, but because the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many of them are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the gender <unk>
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight, I was in a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something was going to be <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when she was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the <unk> of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the expense of <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in front of her, I won in <unk> and I won third <unk> in more than 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was on the queen of beauty of women, but I do so.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that it passed my request for the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mom, "Mom, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like traveling and be a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you give you the United States to you change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was going to put my name on my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities, in Thailand to perform the most sophisticated and safe surgeries to perform the most sophisticated and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver assistance with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many of them are not so lucky.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> she lived his truth, but they were <unk> he put up his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global waking up by the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and he stood up with injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
So today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there's no more <unk> of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So first of all, thank with all my <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and a few times, when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, I was like, "Mom, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's just gender, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, you all assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that <unk> didn't block and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very polite, <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, we have <unk> and tribal societies, to parents usually know about their kids, but I'm one of the very parents who are known to be known for your daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> their efforts in 2011, and when he was <unk> the <unk> National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at a look at the history of mankind, the history of women is the story of the gender of the inequality, the violence and the exploitation.
You see, in the industrialized societies, just since the beginning, when at birth a girl, his birth is not <unk>
He's not welcome and his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood is coming, day of the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> a lot of a young girl.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother <unk> but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and the school can be close to his siblings.
At the age of 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it was 13 years old, you have to prohibit his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if we had the code of that event, honor, could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this code of honor, it doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of family members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor. honor.
And there is a more standard norm of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and that embracing their father and mother and mother decisions even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a old man has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, she has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I did that, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I <unk> all of them were men, and I took my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?"
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of the girl.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore its potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks before, when you look at the <unk> form -- and I was in the relative part to family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my writing sisters in any document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters nor his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go to the different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
I went to my daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I showed you the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and raised up the right to education.
He wrote a day for the BBC, blog of the BBC, he offered her same for the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> as a <unk> all over the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the October of October 2012, 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would give me my wife -- <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please do not <unk>
You know, the fair cause of it.
It will take your life in play by the cause of the truth, because of the status of the peace, and because of education, and your daughter inspired you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't start asking again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe pains and <unk> headaches because his facial nerve, was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to be doing good. Please don't be <unk>
It was an comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights, and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when you didn't just run his task.
They fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so <unk> expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google <unk> of Google, where I had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- but all the work that I will talk today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or out of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain surgery.
You are still like smart or not?
Is it not going to be like that, you may be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to do about a dozen different chemical every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix with chemicals, and try to figure out with life.
Over once I've saved a little more time.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided I would go to try and get the doses of <unk> because it really doesn't have a map of a map that I call it in <unk>
I started testing a different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how little changes in the dose dramatically changed my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
And a particularly <unk> case for a few months, I had an typical chemical <unk> for a man of <unk> and I was shocked to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was, I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't deal with it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for the men and what they have to be <unk> from the men.
What I was trying to do is to make those hormones and neurotransmitters and others, it was regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my thinking, my thinking of ideas.
I usually think almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of <unk> how to make those mental images I use to create <unk> my ideas, if it was <unk> and new ideas and <unk> experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are the people who are going to have this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind. It is to me is a simple thing for most of us, mental images are fundamental for <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I was able to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> really good <unk> and really <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use his imagination only to drive the world only to drive the world on the way?
Or if a musician could take the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way the creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our sound systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of these used <unk> technology -- an MRI picture to represent the brain here, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
And the <unk> column shows the brain scan of that same individual while you're going to see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with a lot of different images, with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into visual <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they <unk> their brains to create a huge pool of reactions in the brain to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and while you get a new <unk>
The computer using the scan of the scan of the scan -- to show what it looks like the person was looking at.
You can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're pretty close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at a picture and when you can imagine that same picture, you create the same <unk>
This is done with the largest brain scanning systems, which is available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull, and you put your <unk>
I don't offer that one.
A lot of you are proposing new <unk> techniques for images, even I knew with the recent result of the <unk> first we must ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way of getting higher resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, more <unk> magnets only give small improvements in the resolution, not by the gains for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: Instead of bigger magnets make better magnets.
We can create structures much more complex with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI went to make really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of brilliant solutions and brilliant solutions in infrared and <unk> and <unk> of FM radio in MRI systems.
Instead of a magnetic field, rather than a magnetic field, <unk> <unk> magnetic patterns.
So as we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing, we can increase mass <unk> the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can split our rising knowledge of the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid blood, but the <unk> and <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas into a direct ideas to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought that the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool for amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few choices more than open this door.
Anyway, you pick a year in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay everyone.
I think we all have <unk>
His self may be to tell some person for the first time you love, or saying somebody who's pregnant, or say to someone who has cancer, or to tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have <unk> in life.
This is all a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived to have come out and have come out of that stage is universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> and <unk> <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be <unk> by the <unk> of my pants <unk> and I would have my head <unk> I would ask me usually a little boy, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would be uncomfortable at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father, <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
He would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came back again.
Are you a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time was prepared and I was about to go into the female issues on the table.  He had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> Gloria <unk>
Even an excerpt from the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I then took a deep breath, and I went down and my back and my back -- a four-year-old girl with a rose dressed in a pink dress with a pink <unk> just a little girl with a <unk> a little girl with a question: "Are you <unk>
And so I went back into the back again, I put it up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair, like a kid and watch clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
I am more than a <unk> girl in a <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. I'm just like, "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation of all I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of them, we were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some lengths in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how it feels like a feeling in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why you get out of my closet was harder than coming out of your life, but this is the obstacle. It's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that you explain to somebody who have declared on banking banking is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than to say to your age of five years that you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard.
We must stop by classifying what is hard to do with respect to the other person to make us feel better, to make us feel better or worse relative to our firms, and we must only feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made -- it's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse butt -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the <unk> lesbian for fighting any four years to go to coffee.
I was frozen because of the fear, he was in a corner of my hometown of my hometown of <unk> my grenade gay, and the moving one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my full friends that I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn around for purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't launch that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my <unk> <unk> and my <unk> lady and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents' friends, people who knew me to do years ago.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women yelled at Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever heard the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite spirit program.
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as all the Scud <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to be <unk>
That's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask any of you who I had <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any trivia is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be true.
You have to have the armor. Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other needs to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> simply <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they say their parents who may be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You would never get sick for that.
And some of you can go out of safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark job -- a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very long -- but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think about it is so interesting as the question of if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to the pioneers of computing like Alan whales.
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
So first we start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from a alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or the neuroscience of Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien ancient that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would have forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to even a certain moment in time, the asteroids that we would have to do that on the surface of a <unk> planet.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, toward a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be inexpensive, adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we will <unk> the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked a number years ago -- there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we could extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for I.Q.
And I think the answer is probably -- what you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of one E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a universal force with the diversity of potential accessible, Yes, until an imminent future time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
Your intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep voting open.
And so having in account this equation, is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Are you the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that those universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have to be trend at more favorable conditions for the existence of smart things like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy entropy in any system that can be found inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to go through multiple animal intelligence, play human games, and even winning money -- actions, all of that didn't be used to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing without a <unk> here we see a pole using a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate throwing away from <unk> opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a <unk> game, against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly being <unk> and it keeps the net very connected.
This is the same <unk> capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering the success and using the Panama Canal to broaden the global level from the ground to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable with problems in transportation, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> they'll spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy on a simulated series of actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk risk will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of cognitive cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom for action.
Now, here is a deep irony.
So back at the beginning of the use of the term of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you were <unk> smart machines, there was a rebellion that would be <unk>
Machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> rebellion in reverse.
It's not that the machines first get smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite.
Another important consequence is the search for target.
I often ask me, "How do you look for targets be <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants of the descendants of building artificial artificial artificial intelligence, is the following: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler bill of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space Telescope.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother.
<unk> this helps us understand if these planets are little and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their <unk>
At its time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for us for us for us, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where we discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more look for planets like the Earth, more like our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit farther from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, demonstrated this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and partly that we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies are now offered not only short space flights but also the <unk> <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images are remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and <unk> ideas, compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still have <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and highest places on the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen that goes through our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will go to a great and sad embrace of the implication and the belief and the belief and the belief and the belief that Mars hope there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> the Earth.
And so I like the <unk> exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to help humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of the Titanic will have place later in the <unk> --   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces, in the hostile areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi -- Enrico Fermi asked the fact that our universe has existed for a very long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider the world advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the origin of the planets that we prescribe this development.
So it's arrogant to think that only ocean colonization, will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table, where there was <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all good off.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get it, and it was cold.
I couldn't come back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because he had a flight early in Europe to the next morning, and my <unk> from my passport and <unk>
They were expensive, but sure that they are not more expensive than a <unk> in the middle of the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was very stuck.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases heart rate, <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter counter on the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something I could do, systems I could put in your place, that I would think that was going bad stuff.
Or at least if bad things happen, you will make the probability of a total catastrophe here.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called the retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, an expert team comes up and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
And in the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then it tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious thing.
At the house, you have a place for the things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make track of the location of things, where the fish are, where the fish, that places the trees live in and where tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that enables you to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and still they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not as good for things that move very much.
This is the reason for losing keys in the car, reading you and <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and are <unk> with it your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards of your credit license, you will stop listening to themselves so you're in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress is not going to be at the best, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one of a loved being, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of their medical choices, and actually for the decision making financial decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that you have to take out of a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack, brain stroke.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most physicians don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to be able to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me anything if not to help me.
But in fact, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the guilt of the doctor, and if it's somebody, it's from the scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms of <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> what they think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is the research of researchers <unk> <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I saw the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, brain stroke or another traumatic event.
Now maybe you're going to think, "Well, 1 likelihood in 300 to my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects. Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain, but they're thinking, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think of clarity.
So think about how to do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people are taking the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out and get out of the drug to help the drug.
I'm not saying that they should be <unk>
I just say that they must have this conversation with their doctor.
<unk> ethics what's required, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this needs to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is actually done in the average men in the middle of 50, prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
So, 49 surgeries for a person who has been <unk>
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or <unk> <unk> urinary urinary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can make that <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to do this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, you want a shorter life in pain, or a longer life that might have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about their family and their loved ones.
You can change the view of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very rapidly. You could get the lions, so none of it matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is <unk> rational, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown me.
So we have to focus on to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went on to the night snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed myself a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the gate of entry in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't heard of, and lots of mail I haven't read before.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
So this is my drawing of a tree of <unk> that you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, never <unk> a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1970s, and over the time it was mixed with local signs, and developed the language we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who live in a sound world -- it's like I lived in a foreign country, following injection their rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example.
"Do not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure we don't get the <unk> in the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm so <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already have sound through the subtle and <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic operation there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I saw museums and various different <unk> and while I was going to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has entered my art.
Am I going to tell you more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or a really experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all they had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and my attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt the sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be taken to me and my art work, or I could be <unk>
I chose I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support as well as and becoming my voice.
So that way of that is able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium in the music world.
And I was shocked to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note is not able to capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning of the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor at the piano, to understand how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide up in many different <unk> parameters,
If you map a different <unk> for every finger as you play the piano, like the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and like that, as you play the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you have a <unk> just one key at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need 10 fingers in the way to express a concept of clear or an idea in <unk>
If one key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning of it.
The same thing happens with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters you can be able to express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> on that."
This is the signal <unk> on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and it would take it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
That's all day."
If you get it, and it <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All the day.
I feel that the same thing can say is that the <unk>
"All MoMA.
This is all night, in this picture.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk>
Look at <unk> hand right, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third thing is, please go back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. but they pass very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
But today, we live in a very controversial world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound automatically has no social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to be deaf, I don't have to hear music.
The <unk> is a treasure trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you take everything, but then you have to <unk>
Health involves responsibility.
But my imagination was brought to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence or a bubble bubble by ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good for cleaning each other.
The time in the country, now I'm an adult and teaching civil and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of crap.
So as good citizens, <unk> the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I didn't get it up.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of <unk>
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these great ships and networks, and we collect those pieces of plastic to study it under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those enormous boat.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've turned our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work with <unk> <unk> so that kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it with my students.
My job is to try and take the best ideas in every child and trying to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of getting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children would be very <unk>
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And transform light bulbs' lights and online web cameras, and they <unk> it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the chunks of plastic floating down through the sensor while the computer on board process this picture and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I was able to go through this stage step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk> kids.
You see the news, they reach the Internet, and you get involved with this <unk>
A child, maybe 10 years ago, cleaning up a oil spill, only using the hands -- in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where they live, the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil are also brown color and when you all <unk> it's very difficult to see what is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
And we put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem -- my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help and help other children.
So I saw a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, maybe addressing a harder problem and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half Japanese and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves that started called <unk> and those <unk> crops in the East Coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power near water.
And today, according to the reports that a 300 tons are still <unk> in the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go on the West Coast, we can measure the radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation was disappeared from the <unk> coast, and the majority of the time, it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the accident and research, independently of other scientists, the land, the Earth, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course they didn't <unk> the parents not <unk>
But every night we reported the <unk> center here -- you see the use of different masks on it.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> their entire life.
Together with them, we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the <unk> <unk> map to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this, we could notice that the radioactive dust is going to be taken from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on that organized a civil expedition -- the closest to the nuclear central to date.
We zoom up to a mile from the nuclear station, and with the fishermen of fishermen in the area we were collecting the sediments of the sea floor with a tracker tracking as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a small way, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology -- basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair in new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful, truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned with the environment and the people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces of steel -- the other one of a silk show.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing I believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only <unk>
But living is not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest unit of life, the cells, we take all the information it required it for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects in order to think about their objects as <unk> of parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act mostly like filter the other mainly like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here is a divided screen, which represents my vision of the world to <unk> the double personality of every designer and architect to work between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the machine and the organism between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right hemisphere -- it shows on the two screens after me.
My job at the simplest level is trying to bring these two views of the world, moving away from assembly and getting to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a strange moment -- where we had four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we never had had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We have to design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, of the big scale, like this robotic arm with an extent of 24 meters of diameter with a <unk> base that someday not very distant to print buildings and graphics in the nanoscale made of genetically <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is a unique size to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a fashion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made of a single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk>
Together with 3D printing collaborator <unk> we printed this layer and <unk> <unk> no seams between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This <unk> <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner as well.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the instruments of <unk> it allows us to design products that <unk> not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the same time, comfortable and also that absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface surface, it becomes <unk>
And we put up this surface of 44 properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by the addition of other material or another, but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible -- and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, including leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with branches, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if the objects could make a <unk>
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the <unk> material, the kind of material of the tree that are <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms.
We thought that if we could tune your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a lot of husks of <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, it built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material about the march and create these structures made of a three or a long, 100 percent <unk>
When the pieces are ready, you keep it dry to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which first showed up for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture a lot of carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> and if it grows even more, to windows.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology, we have a <unk> structure of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects that are designed for <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed in the soil, they'll help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we must master the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> board, we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these electromagnetic crops.
In our first piece of clothing, <unk> two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second E. E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One turns out the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> are not interacting in nature.
In fact, you never get <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help you <unk> these bacteria and that they would get their function on the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the material properties of the material that are <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, they get more transparent <unk>
This system called <unk> <unk> when you stretch out of one end to another, it looks at 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer camp, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life within your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are working creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, including the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit in biology.
I call this material stuff.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer is 3D <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture a home within which it is <unk>
The manufacturing manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it by the combination of the combination of not two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, linking those fibers in each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk silk first is going on in the environment, it creates a structure of tension, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of better understanding how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk silk <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk silk silk silk silk silk silk <unk>
However, when you put the silk silk on a flat patch not within a box, we realized that you would have a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the way, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is <unk> directly through the environment.
They're often <unk> the silk worms into the death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the dumb silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms to the darkest and cool areas so we use a solar route that solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat the heat of the light and the heat worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them very carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and while they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much shorter <unk>
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
At <unk> biological silk on the <unk> <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is the length of the silk route too.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk by a robotic arm, the other empty thing.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a biologically inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by nature inspired us for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever ask them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your toes.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art and started websites -- also playing the guitar in a punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to try and persist in anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was struck by something else, something completely different, and I was going to get me out on it, and I was getting <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn this whole thing in a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my own passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was concerned about commitment, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I would like to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> it from culture.
We ask ourselves first of the question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody matters what they would do to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
I put the <unk> <unk> here.
And this question gets us over and over again, while we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to be asked to be asked in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of the way it takes away the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by kids to dream with what might be, not inspires to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does exactly the contrary, because when somebody asks you, what do you want to be, can't be able to answer with 20 different things, even though adults are maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> professor and creative <unk>
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do with your time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to that.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that make curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And feel something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, so say.
It could help if you divide up in three and potential <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Barbara comes to us as <unk>
You would have any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of fit into a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are enormous strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers in it.
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, of data, traveling and mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
And then the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower is fast learning.
When the <unk> are interested in something, we're going to do that.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and go out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we have to, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a child pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was a planner, financial city.
He had to learn the shortest sales mechanics when he was starting their practices and this ability to make compelling mystery for the editors.
It rarely is a waste of time to go to what you would tell you even if at the end of it you will.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is the adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other pages of web designer.
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take out different roles depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if you're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> that are themselves.
We have complex problems, which is right now, and we need creative thinkers -- not conventional to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> on belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The expert can dive in depth and put ideas, and <unk> provides a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be able to design lives and careers that we need with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely is being told to be more like their <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing you take away from this talk, I hope that this is this: <unk> with the <unk> <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow their curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
They went down the intersections.
<unk> our inner <unk> brings us to a more authentic happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman called <unk> they brought it to a psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until sadly, passed away in <unk>
After his death, they did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain that had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you have been living today, we couldn't get it more help than the one that <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the infections, so many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral cancer for HIV -- <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been made in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, including many of you.
If they wait to live up to 85 years or more, your possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability of your years to spend their age with Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or want to be loved with Alzheimer's disease.
Already only in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spend in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs to increase in five times by 2050, as by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the greatest medical challenges and our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide is the only one that cannot be <unk> cure or even slow its development.
We understand less Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the investigation of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer cancer than Alzheimer's disease in spite of the fact that it costs us Alzheimer's disease and cause a random number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people knows, but everybody is Alzheimer's disease -- Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists even, scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by significantly reducing the life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they're made out of protein molecules.
You can think a molecule of protein like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> spots are on the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein are <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
So we've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this thing works for?
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that it takes it up, and then create a drug that it does.
Until a little bit of a little bit in its most <unk> they have reduced the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, chemical <unk> physicists and math.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that jam specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when you try these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick with each other within them, such as humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in the early stages, then we see that we have a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result, but the research like this shows Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to realize Alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have cracked more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's isn't in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article on the column of New York Times in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, to do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience to try to prove it a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers <unk> to be 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you would go to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really asks me to tell your partner what you like from him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to try this study, with somebody who knew not particularly good, didn't wait for <unk>
However, we were <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the spine in love for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's August, so I suppose some of you probably wonder, do they go together with <unk>
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the issue.
And a week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and I thought my article in the New York Times will be probably a few thousands of noticed.
And that has a very new burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was posted on Friday on Friday night, and then the Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And the Sunday had already called the "Today <unk> and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article received over eight million views, and I was like, <unk> <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence by writing with each other, but another thing is to discover that loving life from one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or written what every day for weeks, they would always ask the same question: Are still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox in my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And so many messages they came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers -- like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put in red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> that included the experiences of the readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both made a public emergence together.
I read television interviews, and he refused for photos of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons of <unk> the <unk> process that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it was really able to make love -- I mean, if it was able to produce loving love, not just a adventure, but a real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real,
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, mostly the wrong question.
How do we know if we go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer would be, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal approach, between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing that, several studies, then we also used world-class protocol for <unk> <unk> as a rapid way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used it between people on opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I took last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you would tell you about the person with whom I <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that they did have gotten better to get the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking at when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation of communication.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to practically my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or she could live without him.
So I was interested in science.
And so I did all I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected it to be able to some form of the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just looked for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it looks really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt it then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or a different way.
I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence.
But I can also see me so clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than that reasonably can support me.
What I'm looking for is a love of love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
So the story of the story that I ask is, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, we would argue that let's make more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how do you know when to cut and get them up.
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good start to have a more conservative conversation about what to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper. The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was no thought of everything that was supposed to be supposed to be.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how sometimes I will keep doing that choice without knowing before, if he always chose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't think of.
And what we knew, and what I may spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit at the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary -- but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a bunch of <unk> and in a way, I was like a <unk> of the forest.
New York ago, a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar ticket a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our sort of <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has a grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment when I was in <unk> <unk> like going to go from <unk> and <unk> and all of those things -- and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it out of all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened, somehow it seemed like it grew up size, as if it was that we would have to make the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements -- weird frogs that was going to find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow out, draw like you do about a dead <unk>
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, we will be able to make a whole idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool, man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size, with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, like a drawing on a window, and then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional landscape.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a great measure in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 kilos.
5.5 feet long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
You're going from the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists for <unk> mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out in a hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like being <unk> which holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a look of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That is the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spits out <unk>
It also has a 5.5 feet away from <unk> feet of snake that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail does turn fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things I go, you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made from 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> in time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material will be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in 20 groups in 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide out.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being caught inside.
This is a little cave on the chest.
That is the <unk> he's the <unk> you can see the ticket.
I will tell you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see it.
This is a dead body in half.
This has two heads and is communicating between the two.
There's a few pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There is a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician -- a musician, a writer -- a musician, a museum <unk> a museum -- that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We put the box and all the people inside it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very facts about the same matter and in the same box.
And if we didn't start to swap those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect on pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill is the most efficient and most efficient system for any drug to make it effect on your body.
The <unk> though, is that <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are useful to decrease the amount of virus into blood, and increase the account of bacterial cells.
But they are also known by their side effects on their side effects on their most negative, because in the time that it takes you to get into the current <unk> you get <unk> and worse in the time that it is where it's more important, in the HIV store in HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily into the blood stream of patients that are tested in the regular therapy of antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great treatment of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for <unk> life by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "I would have to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and facial surgery, you can be used for anything else, including the transportation of drug medicine.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill down in extremely small holes, which open and closing -- almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
And the best people say, "How does that happen?
We sent a little laser beam on the mobile cell membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of time.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it runs the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug releases it directly into the location of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to complete HIV eradication of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the research researcher in our case, a laser treatment with laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
And so what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these police officers and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to non-violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> deals with <unk> peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up in a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we should even be able to <unk> or <unk> in any process of conflict resolution.
But how do we do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very good the reasons why they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they didn't exist.
The armed struggle and the political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> met by their violent <unk> against Israel.
Since their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a social service network and a military device.
Likewise, the Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks, against Israel, also runs the Gaza <unk> from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
Are they multitasking people.
We have a complex machine <unk> stations, radio channels and TV websites and strategies in social networks.
And here is the <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fund of funds without <unk> but through <unk> businesses for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run by hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan ruled by war, or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups for them to deliver safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a huge price price for the population.
But in general, we provide social services that it means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election of 2006 in 2006 is not understanding the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they lived in <unk> gaps by government, and emerge as armed and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can less <unk> as a opposite of a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of the territory, we run all of its <unk> collect the trash running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without the state and hybrids and the weakest of it are states, as in the Middle East -- more <unk> and <unk> that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand the groups better -- we'll understand what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> the military power can win some battle, but we will not give peace and stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that government <unk> that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> label it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I would feel like a bad feminist issue.
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women were <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who could be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's like a higher or higher man.
No one wants to be that <unk> woman until it realizes that it is actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept who I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It was the same for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> or <unk> or violence.
We have the right to use easy way and accessible the contraceptives and the services and the services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and so much more.
We need to have to account these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist issue.
I have another confession:
When you go back to work, I hear rap music <unk>
Even though the letter degrades the women and offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin and yang is amazing.
<unk> actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm totally <unk> by my musical self.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the trash collection of the lawn and the maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my <unk> are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his election, and I'm not who <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, <unk> that choice, too.
The problem isn't that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
<unk> modern feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women, the workers, gay workers, gay women, <unk> women and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist here.
It also happens, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we have to get it to perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think about that <unk> before I try to put myself up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative ones and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be <unk> like <unk>
They have to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> because I am <unk> because of what it means is that <unk> fear cannot be able to meet a little bit realistic enough.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
At <unk> Music 2014, in 2014, he started in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show, looking at this <unk> star embracing feminism and to know how women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started endless arguments, if I was not a feminist.
<unk> their behalf, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for far, we want a lot of -- we need so much, we need so much.
We're going to get a lot more out there of the sane criticism and marketing to <unk> Feminism of any woman's feminism -- until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad deal, or more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from to recognize our <unk> to give the action and be a little more brave.
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy by providing a supply limitless.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting effectively their profits.
It is certainly hard.
Why does his music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions do justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve to, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and very courageous -- I want you to grow up in a world.
And where you get rid of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the power of radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their teammates as <unk> <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to be involved as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help us to be including until more as we have to be <unk> to overcome the barriers to the workplace.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power of directors and the people in the power of CEOs and music music and music, we <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions and more courageous, to create an durable and significant change.
We can also tell with bravery our handsome, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because my voice was <unk> and it was <unk> I helped <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys struck me when it was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I'm going to get my voice, and after all, I didn't believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what we can measure.
Through writing and besides, I also found that if it was a little brave -- another woman could come out and see me and realize that none of us is anything that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other hand, I press the easiest reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad woman. I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope that we can all do the same thing.
I hope that all of us can be a little courageous, when you need a bit more <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had like to visit <unk> or for being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border, with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the measles that may be fatal to a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most likely diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak didn't have been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be supposed to be <unk> the autism.
But a moment, was not the article unleashed on autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being an fraud <unk> by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of being autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard about she believed to develop their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued to stable just three or four children for every 100,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> by funds like <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on here?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control which is going on, what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis, and "a better detection detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son.
If the diagnostic criteria had to ask you, why was it so reduced to the beginning?
Why was the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story is starting with a children's psychiatrist Leo <unk> at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could fun for hours by waving the hands before their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> like when he didn't put his favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the animal patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For 1950, as the primary authority of the world in the subject, I found that there was less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as it was going to get the references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for diagnosing autism, were very <unk>
For example, let me give you that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had been <unk> that he had turned to nine percent of every 10 children sent to his doctor's office by being <unk> without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a way of <unk> child caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, have been very carefully in a refrigerator that they don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents are desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism, became a source of shame for families and two generations of autistic kids -- they were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was rare.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed <unk> without a special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They started a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb in London called <unk> to try and find the children people who are autistic in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism, was a lot more <unk> and diverse in Afghanistan.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with an astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as <unk> said and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How nobody was there was <unk> of these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was <unk> and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for the teaching of children with learning differences were <unk> even contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described it as <unk> disability for life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients as <unk> Asperger's I called them their little teachers, and they started helping the development of education methods that were particularly suited for them.
He saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of concentration and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always been, and seeing aspects of this continuum in architectural <unk> that pop culture like the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was more there until I say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was very wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic to reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by one wider model and <unk>
These changes didn't fell on broken <unk>
<unk> when we <unk> and Judith worked in conjunction to reform these <unk> people around the world saw an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards on <unk> <unk> psychologists, psychologists, and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created an network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just like predicted and <unk> in fact hoped that it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the people with autism, and their families finally replaced the support and services that <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> and a simple, powerful, <unk> history of credible such as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is the right, the people are one of the world's greatest groups.
Over the last few years, people are autistic and the Internet people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that are the puzzles for solving for new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> <unk> and it suffers from attention deficit to detail.
It is certainly people who are people who have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
Seventy years later, we're still achieving <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism, are found in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities and fathers with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk> vessel.
As we went into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as society.
We can't afford to waste any brain.
Thank you.
