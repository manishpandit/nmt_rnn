You know what I do is is is to write for kids, and, and you more read the United States.
And I always tell the people who I don't want to look like a like a scientist.
I can can I look like a farmer, or with leather leather <unk>
I'm here to talk to you a talk to you about to you talk to you about to talk to you about to talk to you like to talk to you about about <unk> and <unk>
And they know what a heck is usually is something that was fell to be.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A was a friend of mine did that -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
It's the kind of complicated that I am going to talk to you.
My first circle started in the years years in in high school, in the middle of the middle of the class.
When I was <unk> up to her every week in the kids until I saved up to me life.
She saved my saved her to enter the into the <unk> in the room.
It was made it on for it.
three years.
And I had to go in the city.
He had a thumb, and <unk> dollars, and I was found a need to start working in working in organizations in fighting against AIDS.
About three or four is half the night I got to have said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults we never got to know us. us.
You could you <unk> and please please bring that man that I know you already found.
And I have got to tell you that I got to do is with you, please."
Well, the day is we were in in <unk>
We went to see, we <unk> the <unk> and we realized what we got to realize that she needed to be <unk>
We found a one place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> was because it was necessary,
It is is something that we knew we knew we knew we knew we knew we knew we knew we knew we knew we knew we did.
And as one is the woman who I wanted to be, as as as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box box, and he put on in my hands.
And what was what happened is was the one of us is is in in in is in in is in us is in in in in is in the world in in present to them.
The epiphany is is that death is part of is to life.
She saved my saved my saved her saved her.
And they know that that of life needs all the rest of of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about a lot.
It also needs to make those things.
Thank you.
As I was an artist, the connection is to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not are separated from nature and everything interconnected.
I went for for the first time -- almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can a very fast, heart I was in front of what I was in front of me.
I was <unk> to the <unk> water is almost about almost 60 feet.
<unk> are are born when you are from the glaciers or they break out the <unk> barriers of the ice.
Each iceberg has their individual personality.
They have a different way way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some people are <unk> to lie, and hold up to the more <unk> in <unk> in <unk>
It's really easy to be thinking by by when you see a <unk> that you're isolated <unk> and themselves, as we humans.
But the reality is the other way to do.
As a <unk> is I'm breathing up its ancient atmosphere.
As I as it feeds up in many forms of life.
I walk up to shoot these <unk> as they were all <unk> portraits in that way.
It's not not death when they are <unk> is not a end, not be a end of their way through the life cycle.
Part of the <unk> ice was photographing that is a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over is over a thousand years.
The last few pictures I would like to show is are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are is from a a difference that I photographed at <unk> <unk>
It's just like to be able to actually really come to see you a really going to be going to be really going to be really going to actually actually get to see you really going to be really going to actually actually get to see a one <unk> diet.
Here you go. them.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet feet.
And I would like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has been moved to the other and the man is standing up there.
This is a one is one a average size, Greenland, Greenland, average.
<unk> of the water about about a half a foot or 40 feet meters.
This is actually be in real time.
And <unk> the iceberg exhibit a different side side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, is exactly at the same time, -- is exactly at the same time, -- is exactly at the same time, -- is exactly at the same time, -- is exactly at the same time, -- is exactly at the same time, -- is exactly at the same time, -- is exactly at the same time, -- is exactly at
So, two couples every one was with a baby.
I don't want to be <unk> too much in the details because of the details is to think of in the conception of I don't want me to pay attention to.
Let's think that for for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that in a case, the chromosome and sperm is is a chromosome into the X chromosome chromosome to the X chromosome. box.
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joins the bacterial chromosome to the X chromosome chromosome to the X chromosome. X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X <unk> X X <unk> <unk> X about. <unk>
They both <unk> and the life starts life.
We're going to talk about it later.
In my land activity will come two in the two roles.
In one of my job work on with the story story.
I'm a <unk> because of what I study is in in this is the way people started to say that human bodies and the idea are you think about the body.
The other thing that performance is performance is is is is is is is is is is <unk> <unk>
In this case, I've been working with whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been doing -- for example, with two two people two people in inside of ...
I've been working with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases with people who in the physical typology doesn't fit in in the male <unk>
In large, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many different ways.
I'm going to put some examples of examples some examples of ways we had a other things have a sex that doesn't <unk> in male or female,
For example, is that the <unk> that we all have in in in <unk> life.
And then in in the <unk> life, the testes are organisms produce testosterone.
But since this is because this individual has lacks the body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> of you <unk>
So, there are high testosterone levels are not reaction.
As a consequence, the body is develops on by following a way in following a different way as female <unk>
When <unk> the baby looks a young girl.
It's just raised as a young girl.
And often, it's even even puberty, you are growing and developing and developing the breast but -- doesn't have the time period to when someone realizes something is happening.
After it makes tests realize that instead <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a <unk> chromosome.
The important thing to understand is is that you think this is about a man, but is really not like this.
Women, as they are men, as we have in the body is something called <unk> <unk>
They're all in the back of the body.
<unk> <unk> produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most of the women are as I was -- is to be a <unk> woman <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody is like I like the <unk> brain is <unk> to the <unk>
That's why is why do the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in them in in some way they can all be in everywhere.
Another one is another example a few years ago, I got a call from a <unk> year-old <unk> born and raised as he was <unk> he was had was <unk> and <unk>
He had a very extreme way to <unk> <unk>
He had chromosomes in and the <unk> glands were were so active that in creating -- were were so active that in creating -- were were so active that in creating -- were were so active that in creating -- were were so active that in creating -- were were so active that in creating -- were were so active that in creating -- were were so active that in
As a consequence, their genitalia was <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born <unk> no one one is <unk>
And it was was at the age of years, he started to have had trouble problems with by <unk> when doctors discovered that was in actually was a woman women in inside.
Well, another quick one is a <unk> <unk>
Some people have they develop what you as <unk> is -- wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that is happen.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason is that the children are with these kinds of bodies have to be used to <unk> <unk> <unk>
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are they are tested for several surgeries is is is that they are a threat to for our social categories. categories.
The system is normally based on in the idea that one particular anatomy brings out of <unk> a particular identity.
So we have the idea is that to be a woman is to be is to have a black <unk> to want to have any anatomy anatomy at all.
A whole idea is a terribly simplistic idea.
And when we have a a body shows something quite different, we have problems with you something quite different.
So we have a whole different ideas in our culture in the <unk>
Our nation is based on in a concept of <unk>
Imagine what is you have children to have children are born in in in a very same body.
The most most height is this is the last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of a lot of of the reporters called up to wonder, is it a man or <unk>
And I had to explain the journalists that doesn't such as you as a test.
In fact, we now know that the sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature does not plot a <unk> line between men and women and women and women or women, women, women, are the ones who we made.
So what is we have is a situation in which the way we did is to do.
And not just in of sex.
And also in the one is something much more complicated about what the <unk> terminology looks like.
As we see, we put ourselves in into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for for the fact that we share at at least 95 percent percent of of of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What is you a few <unk>
And as we have we got to know that the <unk> categories are <unk> are likely to be aware of.
And we're looking at in all walks of walks in the human life.
One of of them, for for in our current culture, in the U.S. and in the end of life.
It's a hard way to set you a way to that a body gets a human and it has has got to have different different to the <unk>
There are very dramatic arguments you are now <unk> in the day today, <unk> not in the day today, it is <unk> in the day today, it is <unk> not in the day we are today -- <unk> not in the day we are today -- <unk> not in the day we are today -- <unk> not in the day we are today -- <unk> not in the day today,
Our ancestors had never had to go with with this is a question of if someone was died.
As long as they got a pen in in front of didn't you like that.
If I stopped you to move that out.
But today, we can now have to get vital organ organs to put them in in a other body.
And as a result, as a result, we need to address the dilemma of actually that we don't have the simple categories in the past.
And you may think that this is this explosion as I am.
In politics am I am a <unk> making people a little nervous.
And I think that these categories are are are much more fragile than we thought to me.
<unk> it is from the concept point of view.
And to tell you about this is this is first to admit that I am I am -- that is be -- that I am -- that is be -- that I am -- is that I am to be is to admit that I am I am a fervent for the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> they were <unk> but they were <unk>
I mean, they were very smart, and bold, and radical and meet me every way to see that <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> they were, for for me, the first <unk> of the anatomy and ask them why.
What was they were <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk>
And, as you all remember, our <unk> our <unk> <unk> was in a very <unk> concept of <unk>
The monarchs have the monarchs are in the old old old old old old world did not know the idea of you the idea of the birth of a birth.
They had a concept of blood.
They were from the idea that it was coming in the idea that was the political power for the father to the father and father, and forth, are so on.
<unk> <unk> was rejected that the idea and replaced the idea was that was that all men are are men in are <unk>
They <unk> the a game and decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they
And they're partly doing it because they were part of a <unk> system in which they were about two things.
It was <unk> the democracy and at the same same science is in the time.
And it's got very clear, if we look at in the history of the <unk> <unk> that was you were very interested in interested in in the idea of the people were were very interested in interested in in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> with the <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of a concept of <unk>
They were were moving to a <unk> concept.
And if we look for for for -- for for -- for for the example, the Declaration of Independence is you talk about and the god God.
They don't talk about and the God of God.
They talk about power to tell us who we are.
And a result, we were people being passing the idea of the idea of <unk>
And by by the way they were the foundations of the future future people are <unk> are the foundations of the foundations of the future future people are <unk> are the foundations of the foundations of the future future people are <unk> are the foundations of the foundations of the future future people are <unk> are the foundations of the foundations of the future future people are <unk> the foundations
They didn't think that that way, it was like it for it for it, for it for us, and it was really cool.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then I was the success of the Civil Rights Movement was us with people have been people from <unk> <unk>
We found men in in the lines of the Civil Rights Movement was saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people are people in <unk> at the <unk> difference and again, are <unk>
We see the same same same thing with the <unk> Movement is <unk>
The problem is of you have to start why we keep in certain <unk>
But so, I want to keep some more <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a a fish the same individual the same selves to for a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> at the first anatomy.
I don't want to say that the year kids were to have to have sex or married.
There are as much more <unk> are more <unk> that I think we should.
But the challenge is to try to find out what they are, why they will keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep you going to keep you to keep up and make sense sense.
Well, let's go at those two to you at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the exact same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, you was was three time before the June 1, 1980.
All the other thing was -- was that I was that I was in that is that I was that I was in that is that I was that I was in which was I was that I was that I was in which was I was that I was that I was in that the one of the March 1980. March 1980.
For only one is the one of the rights three months before the rights is to be attribute three to the rights of the right to the right, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all this is not because it is a different age, but because of was born afterwards.
We found out other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, are all of in the virtue of being considered man -- -- -- -- -- if I was not been told whether it's a <unk> <unk>
Mary.
Henry could marry in all states with a woman, but is just married in in some states.
So they still <unk> the different categories in that in various ways are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is the time to have to admit that a democracy is based to be.
I don't want to give science -- not at the same same time, sometimes I feel like that science is <unk>
Where do we go to where we go here?
It looks like that as we are going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in in in a very rare position.
For example, was Texas at a certain time has been decided to be going to have to marry a man you don't have to have to have got in.
Now in the practice don't they do people go to the people.
But this is also as a very strange thing because the story was telling you about at the early <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of the founding fathers of the founding fathers of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founding fathers were founding very founding parents of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founders of the founding
It says that we should people judge people <unk> not in the color of their <unk> going beyond beyond beyond the anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems like a good one."
But in the way, how do you do it?
How are you judge the people based to the content of the <unk> content in the <unk> content.
I want to point also not sure we should we have we been involved in -- that I know I know -- that I know -- I know I know some of them -- -- that I know I know about -- I know I know some of them -- -- <unk> that I know I know about -- that I know I know about -- I know I know
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> you <unk> can be able to do is to make you more <unk> smart <unk> are I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content <unk> for <unk>
It's really been very hard.
And one was a part of you the wonder what would happen if the character would happen if the character would happen if the character would happen if the character was to happen in the future will be measured with an instrument,
We want to actually get to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
I know what it seems to be very important to be very important to happen to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very
We've made a good job of work in for democracy and I think we are going to do good work in in the future.
We don't live for, for for example, in a context as the Iranian person is is attracted to for is is <unk>
We are not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we have no context -- like a one of the surgeon I spoke about a couple years ago that I had made to give you to give birth <unk>
But when I was asked her the reason for he was -- was -- -- -- -- that in that other kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do.
And I said to what I said, "Well, has been to be considered the political asylum asylum House instead of <unk> in <unk>
America offers really enormous possibilities for people to be in the way to the people in the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, I just want to say that I've been talking about a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, as if we had to be given more a more great more you had to give you more a more more more given to you more a more great people would we had to be given more a more great more you had given more a more more more given to you more a more great people would we had
And I want to say something a little bit about for a feminist, a feminist, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Since I've since I've been interested in in <unk> I've also been interested in at investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested to me, are the differences and women and women think and operate in the world.
And what we do we know about <unk> is is that the women women, on on average is is that women women, -- is is is is that women women, on average, -- is is to pay more more attention to the group.
And if we think about that, have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was at <unk> one of my advisers who knew I was interested in in <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk> have <unk> have <unk> have <unk> have <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question.
Feminism is is to get rid of get rid of of the <unk> the <unk> so there's nothing in <unk>
But the more I have I thought about in your question, it has been to me like there is something like to be a <unk> thing like in <unk>
I mean, that there might be on on on average, something is different between the female and male is to make us more well <unk> to the social brains and the most vulnerable.
So well as a <unk> were they were very close to find a way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way to find the way
And maybe that is what we have to do in the future when we were, democracy is beyond the individual -- to think less less about the individual body in in in in and think more about relationships.
So, as we are trying to create a more <unk> more perfect <unk> as we think of what we do ones for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to <unk> how do we think about the economic development.
Our new goal should be when when you want to go to go to have a chance to choose between at least a handful of different different lives in for.
Well, at this point, we are far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing people in in developing countries in developing people in in developing countries in developing people in in developing countries in developing people in in developing countries in developing people in in developing countries in developing people in in developing countries in developing people in in developing countries in developing people in in developing countries in developing people in in developing countries in developing
But the amazing thing was there is striking amazing to the cities is that are worth a much more good worth of more than their cost cost for.
So we can easily answer to the <unk> world -- maybe hundreds of you were cities.
Well, it can sound absurd if you have never thought about a new cities.
But they just went to the buildings buildings in apartments.
Imagine that the half of you who would want to live in a apartments go to the other way to do it to do.
You could try to increase the capacity in all of the existing buildings.
But you really know the problem you <unk> is that those buildings and the areas have rules to avoid the things rules to avoid the <unk> rules of have rules of rules have rules to avoid the <unk> rules of them.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But then they could actually go to a whole new place, to build a whole new way to as long as is the standards rather as we put in <unk>
So I proposed that governments to use new new areas systems for <unk> cities in <unk>
I later I learned that as I was more or less at the same time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time or less at the time
Did you know that every year about about it every year about -- would they come up in their country to the country to the country to go to the country to you know that those people could do to make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure
In the summer of the summer of 2009, it was happened by a a a whole constitutional crisis, we <unk> went by by a a big <unk> crisis.
In the next few other <unk> they <unk> the <unk> imposed the <unk> to the same same time is reconciliation.
He was asked of <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was actually preparing for me to give you a <unk> talk.
Through the trial and trial and trial and trial and was tried to tried to try to try this complicated concept of <unk> <unk>
The first point was that was the current current current <unk> to do.
We <unk> a lot of attention to the new new technologies, but it takes as much technologies like for rules for <unk>
In the fall of 2010, a group friend was sent a <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders leaders for us.
So in December did we met in a meeting in a room conference room in a room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable are as valuable as they are.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land value in in a place as New <unk> dollars dollars.
But it was was a very whole kind of abstract argument and at some time, when I got to say, said, <unk> maybe we could we could see the video of <unk>
And I talk about that talk is very simple that a city is <unk> a <unk>
So the president of <unk> was called me -- and said to me, is the way for our country has to do.
He was asked for me to be <unk> and talk about the four and five <unk>
So I presented a other talk full of data, which it included a picture is like this -- that was trying to be much about a lot of value to a city is this has to do.
This is is a picture of <unk> and the white line is is a <unk>
Just this is cover over more than 100 miles square miles.
So I was trying to convince the people to get to convince the <unk> to convince them to convince the <unk> to convince them to convince them to convince the <unk> to convince us to convince them to convince the <unk> to convince them to convince the <unk> to convince them to convince the <unk> to convince us to convince them to convince the <unk> to convince them to convince
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk> <unk>
The face of the audience were were very serious about it.
The <unk> leader came up to came up to the platform walked up to the platform walked up to the platform came to over to the platform and said, <unk> Thank you very much through the talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I got this in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this was the <unk> the <unk> that was a new city can new choices choices can be offer new options.
There would be a city option to which you could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away at the time.
And they also <unk> new choices choices for leaders.
Because the government leaders needed to help them help them to help you set up and make the rules of you could all trust that the <unk> they can actually <unk> for.
We went and saw a site.
This is this picture is in there.
It could easily account about a thousand square miles.
And soon I was on the 19th of January, you voted on in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add to you that allow you to make these special special regions. regions.
In a one country I had just had had had had just gone through by the one country that was as we went through by this is by the voting for <unk> to you at one.
All the <unk> all are <unk> in in the society, the <unk> <unk>
In order for the <unk> is you have to pass twice in in Congress.
The <unk> 17 was actually passed a other way to <unk> to one.
Immediately after the <unk> in the age to the <unk> to the <unk> to the two are places in in in the world that are most interested to participate in in.
One of them is is South Korea.
This is this is a picture of a new city center that is is building in in Korea, is bigger than the center of in Boston.
Everything is in there was built in in in four years, after it was four years to get the <unk> up.
The other thing was interested in building cities is is in is is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two in the city cities and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this as a <unk> this is where we are.
They have to be thinking about in for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system to allow them to allow managers to be able to operate under a external legal system.
A is a country already committed to allow her to allow this whole new justice system.
There are <unk> cities that are very interested in in the project.
You can even get some of these funding.
But the one was the one only one thing we know they have to have been solved is is is is is is is is is is that they have a good number of have a good good number.
There's a lot of people who wanted to be in in <unk> especially in a place with a free <unk> zone and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world are of people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year to the year it comes out of the <unk> to the year to go to the United States.
Many of them are all of you have to go back to their family to go to get a work -- sometimes they have to earn the money money to buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even are kids are who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in in some cases in a decade.
So what is you think about in building in the city in <unk>
Or do we build a dozen these these, or a hundred all over the world around all over the world?
What do you think to think about to the families that families you think to think about for families to get the families to have a different city cities to bring up with.
This is a idea worth spreading.
And my <unk> friends were they asked for to say, "Thank me to say, "Thank you to say, for TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is is this is my <unk>
But before I show you what you are in -- are going to make a live with <unk>
I love to find, and and much more recently, photograph and publishing and in my blog and <unk> and <unk>
But I didn't have no new stuff.
All of my clothes is is is a <unk> markets markets for <unk>
Oh, thank you.
<unk> <unk> allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment is in in the environment and in <unk>
I go to know the people to go to know the people in <unk> for all of my money go to a good <unk>
I mean, what will you find today?
It will be about to be about to be.
I will like to do.
It's cost less cost less than 20 dollars?
If all are answers are positive, then I feel like I have won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want I want to tell you what to be in for this exciting thing at TED.
I mean, what does that bring you to someone that has all have all of you have all of you who have all of you.
So I'm going to just exactly what that I worked for.
I brought up seven pairs in <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is is what I've been put in in in <unk>
I thought that it would be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
And I because I don't have a woman who walks up for for the woman walking up for for <unk> <unk>  that means I found a few things.
And I just like to show you the sets for this week.
Doesn't it sound that sounds interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you about some of the lessons from life -- which, <unk> or not, have learned in in this is not use new clothing.
Let's start with a Sunday.
And I call this a brilliant. brilliant brilliant.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see you a really great way to look for for for less than 50 dollars. dollars.
All of the together, included me <unk> it was with me -- is me -- is -- and is the most expensive I've been used in a week.
<unk> <unk> is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, are you going to attract other other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself. yourself.
If you were <unk> in the right people -- not just <unk> you as well.
<unk> <unk> the child who are in in.
And sometimes people seem to be like play to the <unk> or I can remind me that it seems like I play to the <unk> or I can remind me that it seems like to play the <unk> or I can remind me that it seems like to play the <unk> or I can remind me that it seems like to play the <unk> or I can remind me that
I like to say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you are good at you very good with something, it's pretty sure you like you.
And if you think you do well as well as well.
My mother taught me that day after day.
But it wasn't until I was really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you are you are beautiful people beautiful and the outside, not look a look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse not not think of this audience.
We must be able to be able to do everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A <unk> true universal truth about six words for you.
And finally, is we <unk> a personal style is is a great way to say to the world something to the world something to do.
And I've tried to and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and over again and when people came to me with this just for what I was using, and we had so fantastic.
Obviously this is all of this is not go to go into my small <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, to me just to give it all.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this a week is is you have to leave this a back certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> these things, because it turns out there will always be another one other <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is is a representation of your brain that we can we can split in in two parts.
The left side, which is the one and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right side is and the right
So therefore if you go a a scale to the way we could actually design a a blueprint of our brain.
For instance, this is be somebody who is just be to be somebody is all.
This is be somebody that is be totally intuitive.
So where is you look at at this scale?
Some of you were ends, but I think that for most of the members of you -- is is a kind of is with a great big <unk>
It's not not be another <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one one of those people, the same as well as most other quantum forms <unk> we need a very logical logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at at the same same time, we need a pretty intuition to do that experiments really work.
How are we developed this <unk> well, we like to play with things.
We just put in play with them, and then we look like that is to do.
And actually, you do the same same thing. itself.
And <unk> intuition is that you can have developed with the year is is the one that says one thing might can only be only in a place at once.
That is to think that one thing is in the same same same same time, -- the <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing on a <unk> <unk>
It was not just done very well, it is always <unk>
But I bet that the game is to play with that bar has taught me a very big valuable valuable valuable valuable thing.
This is a very big conceptual model that you can have in the world, you can have the world except you be a physicist <unk>
It would be a great model for a lot little particles are.
And when they do they play with their particles, they discover they all do all sorts of things like they can go through walls, or can they go through walls different different places.
And then they did these observations, and the called quantum theory theory -- and the called the quantum theory theory -- and the called the theory theory of quantum called it theory theory of called quantum quantum theory theory for us.
And at the point was a a few years years -- needed to describe those small little little little bit. mechanics.
But you didn't need to describe the big big objects around us every day.
And that is not be good at my intuition, that intuition, it does, and maybe it's not play very much to with the particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen before.
I mean, never just saw a <unk>
But it also also do well be good at my good logic.
Because if everything is all follow the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why not have been.
And therefore I felt much better if if I could actually show that a common object is following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why is I really do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in in a different <unk> <unk>
What we see here is is is a one little computer chip.
And they can try to see the green dot right right in the way.
That's the one that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm just going to zoom that a a little bit.
And then here we do a very good way to the little little metal <unk> a very good <unk>
What we can see is is is a a little pair piece of metal metal, <unk>
And then I did that almost as well you would do a computer chip.
I went to a a room with a whole level of machines for for about about a 100 hours. hours.
In order to for I had had to build my own machine -- to do is under the device.
This device is has the ability to be in in a different <unk> but to do it need a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy. analogy.
You know what it is to be on in a elevator full of the people.
I mean, when I was in a elevator just is -- I do make all sorts of things happen, because I don't want to do it <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that causes inanimate things behave the same same same same same same way.
<unk> <unk> are not just of the light light that the <unk> and the wind that goes to the <unk> and the wind it is and the passes on to the side and the <unk> goes on to the room.
So we knew what we knew that we wanted this little metal to behave according to all the other other other bit. on so much.
And that's what we did.
It was <unk> the lights then <unk> a <unk> and we got it up at at a temperature at less than one is about above at all.
Now, by being just in the <unk> the little metal is is is just free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that was move in in very weird ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, there -- is as a breath in this way -- -- as a <unk> which is expands to and <unk>
And by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by giving it a smooth soft, we could we were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
So what is I'm telling you is really is something really cool.
What does that mean that one thing is, and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think think about that atoms.
In one is -- all of the billion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion
It's just in the <unk> when you were <unk> for.
In the rest of the time are they are <unk> for.
It means means to say that every single ant is in is in is in two different places.
I think this is really cool.
Seriously.
But was it the wrong thing as difference the difference difference the difference is.
So if I just take it up, can you be in two different places different at at the same same same same time, can be in in two different different places. different places.
I mean, is my question that you like you talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at the same same same time, as we were at the same same same time, -- how would you look like that?
How do your consciousness is if consciousness is if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it is and we turned the lights and we looked at that the metal was still on was still still in in the single piece.
And I was able to get to get this new intuition, seemingly all all objects objects on in the elevator actually is really only <unk> in a small small space.
You can talk a long way to talk a very long way to talk a lot to talk a whole whole interconnected thing.
Well, that's not not that <unk>
It's more than that, is more profound.
It is is that the connections is to all the things that you are. and that is -- and that is that you are. -- that you are. -- and that's that is the deep part is that is that you are.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 ends) 18 months ago.
It took me 18 months to and and <unk>
Lots of negotiations and stories, they would put it out with 17 very interesting interesting country.
But I'm going to go about in the <unk>
There is a whole bunch of stories stories we did.
I think that my own story is is to think about it just just in this slide and this is and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- -- -- -- -- -- not have no access to a many of these museums and artwork.
So I as I started to go to go to go to go to go into the museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on the Google, I try to actually make the wish to do it more accessible through through through through by by through technology.
So we formed a a big big people and started to do that.
You better that the demo is to then then you give you a very interesting thing of interesting things interesting that we have been on for from their launch.
So, <unk> are we going to <unk>
Look around all the museum out there.
There is <unk> <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go in in one of my favorites, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> Museum in the York.
There are two ways to do it -- -- very simple.
We click and forth and <unk> we're already inside the <unk>
It doesn't really really matter.
You move around the there and <unk>
They want to navigate for <unk>
We opened the flat up, and we just jumped on in.
You are want to go to the end of the hall,
I keep going, you <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but not come to the best.
Now I'm in front of in one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> <unk> did it <unk> in <unk>
I see the <unk> sign sign is.
If the museum shows is the picture, you click out there.
Look, this is is one of the pictures.
Here's the whole data data out here.
For those of you who are really interested in in art, you can click on right right now.
And this is one of the images that we called the <unk> technology. technology.
So this is -- for -- -- that -- I think, is about 10,000 million vertical dollars.
And many people are people who ask me, "What do you get in with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really gets to show you what you really gets to show you what you really got to show you what you really got to show you what you really gets to show you what you really got to show you what you really got to show you what you really gets to show you what you really got to show you what
And can we zoom in around in all very simple.
You can see really fun that are happening.
I love this guy, your speech doesn't have no price.
But if you really want to do is <unk>
So I started that I started playing, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, is this seem a <unk>
And I found that the kids were actually actually playing something.
So I talked about a few people in the <unk> and actually I discovered that this is is to hit a <unk> with a <unk>
And it was seem very popular.
I don't know why they did, but have learned something about about this.
And now are we just get to get up even more deep into and you'll see that you really can get to be able to be in the cracks.
Now just do I just give you a a little perspective, perspective, I'm going going to see really what it is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing better is to come, a second.
So we're very quickly going quickly to jump to at MoMA in New in the York.
Here's another one is of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was was was was to find out the details.
But what happens if you want to look like the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and actually that we <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite bits in in in this frame, and I really am going to go to the cracks.
This is the <unk> night, I think I had never seen this as well.
I'm going to show you another one other from my favorite functions.
There are more things more more about here, but I don't have time for <unk>
This is this is the really cool part part.
All of you, absolutely no matter is that the same the same.
You can create your own own museum together, create their own collection to from all of you can in online.
It's a very simple way we walked in, -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I've created this is this thing that I call "The power is <unk>
It's the <unk> in the National Gallery <unk>
You can put things out, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like to look at the contemplating these different <unk>
So, in the way, I think about to me, the main thing is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that be the main thing is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that
No, are we even not come about in well as well as well as well.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come in from those artists.
And that's been my experience with this.
I hope I hope that in this digital does it be does justice in it is do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it justice to do it
And the big one is the big question is today is is, they got this to repeat the experience of the experience experience is to do.
And the answer is is no.
It is to supplement the experience.
And that's all. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think about it is is a <unk> one <unk>
In our lab is we call this a sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about about this.
If you look at in this picture -- I be is something that has happened very interesting has happened.
A long time, if I wanted to win a <unk> one, and a good car, a car,
And if the car is and the car was -- were good enough, the race.
This is what we in engineering, it was <unk> a real-time control control control control control control control system control control control system control control control system of control control of control system.
It's basically a system that has two <unk> a <unk> has two <unk> <unk>
Now what's really interesting is that the control systems are in real time systems are are beginning to go into in in our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're just <unk> in the air, <unk>
And, <unk> are starting to respond in differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is is a big thing.
As I can notice that cities are are only two percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the <unk> are <unk> and up to the percent percent of the CO2 emissions. of of <unk>
If we could do something to be something a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are in in our everyday objects.
This is a <unk> exhibition show for for the end of the year during <unk>
It's called an <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it is as well as they were in there -- <unk> and <unk>
And that is changing the interaction that we humans humans human, humans humans human, is with with with with with with with with with. as humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans humans human, is with with with with with with us.
In a way, it's almost like in the old <unk> <unk> <unk>
You already can see a angel <unk> the <unk> is you still see a little little bit <unk>
Well, now, for the first time is our environment starts to get it out.
And I'm just going to just show you just about <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk>
Let's start starting to start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is one of the first first first first project in our lab.
This was about four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was kind of was a summer in the summer and luck of in 2006.
It was as a year I won the World Cup won the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they were they were playing and Italy in and France, and at the end of the <unk> gave the <unk> to.
And anyway, the end is in Italy.
Now see what happened is that day you look at by looking at the <unk> activity on the web.
Here we see here is the city.
You can see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before I play.
The time line is in the top.
At the early afternoon, there are people over here and there and making called <unk>
It starts silence.
<unk> in France.
<unk> people make a call a call and go to the <unk>
Second <unk> End of time.
First <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk> <unk>
They win in Italy, yeah! yeah!
That night all was <unk> to the center.
You look at the big <unk>
The day they all went to the center of you were all went to the center to the middle of you were all went to the center to the middle of you were all went to the center to the middle of you were all went to the center to the middle of you were all went to the center to the middle of you were all went to the
And then the whole is <unk>
You see the <unk> in the day day.
This is just one example of how you can actually measure a different pulse of the city a way we would not have been able to be able to do was just a few years ago.
Another quick example is <unk> are not all about it as we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the source of our objects.
This is is a map that shows all all of the chips that we got up with -- how would you look like?
But we know what things go things.
So this is why we developed a little little tags little tags to track the trash in the system.
We started we start with a few volunteers that they helped us in in in in a year a little year over over more about a year to as you can can see -- things all things in <unk>
Then we put you a little little bit like a <unk> into the <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information that we realized that there are are <unk> in in the system.
We can do the same same with much less energy.
These are the data data existed before.
There are is really complicated things and <unk>
But the one is the other thing we think is is that if we look at every day that the cup is the cup are still somewhere still somewhere somewhere still.
And if the plastic bottle we <unk> the day is still still <unk> up there.
What if we show that that to people, then then we can actually encourage some other change change in that if we can.
That was the one is the project.
My <unk> colleague at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at
And the one was the first project is something we did a couple years years ago.
It was all started a question of the mayor of the city -- have a beautiful <unk> of have a beautiful tradition of have a beautiful <unk> of have a beautiful tradition of you have a beautiful and South south have got a beautiful <unk> of have a beautiful tradition of you have a beautiful and South south have got a beautiful <unk> of have a beautiful tradition of have
And the question was, how can you technology technology, new technology, you come into that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at at at at the at a shop to in for at a shop to imagine you have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was creates as a water <unk> with <unk> water.
If you land the pixels is can be written in in them in them, to show you like they can show patterns patterns, images, you <unk>
And by <unk> the curtain will is open up so that we could see in the image.
We presented it to the mayor of <unk>
It liked well as much a lot.
And <unk> a did to design the <unk> entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole whole building is made of water.
There's no windows no windows, but when you get to open up to the one can you will.
The roof is also is is as well.
And if there's a bit of wind, you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the ceiling.
Or you can close the whole building and the whole architecture is is in -- like this.
I will always have someone else in in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who's was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, not you have been <unk> but when you lower the architecture goes down.
This is work.
You can see people <unk> what it goes in.
And I'm just trying to do is when the water sensors open the water.
I think I should do is what happened a night when all the sensors had to go to work.
That night it was really even more fun.
All of the kids in <unk> they came to the way to the building because the way had changed a little bit.
It was no longer have to jump to not don't go to.
<unk> <unk>
But then it is always unpredictable. unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of you that people use.
This is a picture of the building is with the water pixels and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next next project I'm going to show you to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start start to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters helicopters and the air is changes in color as it is changes in color as it is changes in the <unk>
This is is the video video.
Imagine a one we saw before that moves to others in <unk>
Could we form this cloud, cloud,
A kind is like this is with a separate screen looks like this is with a very two dimensions.
Or is we in three dimensions, where it changes is is is is is not not be the position is is is is not be the position changes.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears to appear in different and scales in different different types resolution.
And that that is all of that could be a cloud of <unk> in the one you can close to and and see in very different <unk>
This is this is the real <unk> are <unk> going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going
When the light is to you look at this.
Imagine each one of them is for being controlled by for a person.
We can we have every pixel with you that comes to the people, people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> the best best dancers to do.
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left is you see the <unk> the <unk> catch up in the other.
So it's so often <unk> in real time as it's motion capture.
You can <unk> all the whole movement.
You can go through all the way.
And once we once have the pixels are we can play with them, with the color and the <unk> and the <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input to for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last last project that we are working on.
It's a thing for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is to imagine again, that we could actually involve people to do something and change our <unk> environment as they grow as they as they calf <unk> as they as they grow as they <unk> as they as they as <unk> as they as <unk> as they as <unk> as they as they as they as <unk> as they as they as they as they as they
Imagine that we could all of you <unk> a a little bit for a little bit.
And I think the remarkable thing has happened in in the last last two years, we move the physical world to the last year. world.
We have digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to through the Internet.
Today, I was the first time -- and the Obama campaign is we asked us -- we can go about to us -- we can move in the back of the Obama Obama campaign is us <unk> we can move to the one of the Obama Obama campaign is us <unk> us -- can we move to the one of the Obama Obama campaign is us <unk> we can go
In our case, this may that we want to design and make a <unk>
That means is a city in town.
But tomorrow may be to address the challenges of are now -- to think about the climate change or is to go about the digital world to the <unk>
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this, different <unk>
The cloud is a new way that the cloud is is is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are as water, as we are in the cloud are the fall.
It's is a physical structure in London, but ice is <unk>
You can move inside inside to have different experiences.
You can actually be used as a way to connection to the community.
So it's as much a light cloud of the sky as something can you can go to as a a new <unk>
You can go into that you can go in there.
And as if I was a new <unk> digital <unk> at at night, but is to be a new thing to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, just about a little changes in their genes could be better do it by by by a more more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you like to be better -- it will be stronger to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about to live more good for <unk>
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is you more you <unk>
What would you like to choose something?
<unk> in the <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity? to choose creativity?
Hands up. hand.
<unk> It was probably was for you probably have the number of you are creative people present.
That's really good.
How many would you <unk> memory?
A few more.
And the thing is what is the <unk> state and the <unk>
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you -- that makes me feel very well as a medical doctor.
If you could have something to be a very different thing.
It's just <unk>
Or is maybe a possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at in here at the TED Conference but I want to give you a look a look on the whole thing.
The big big <unk> of the 20th century has makes sense sense for <unk>
But if they effectively embrace the consider that look to consider this -- this is consider this: this is is just about the past, or in the future?
It's just about the other one other or us? or us?
This is one other look into the tree of life.
The human part is as well as we are interested in.
<unk> of a common ancestry ancestor with the modern chimpanzees about about about eight or eight or eight dollars.
There has been perhaps maybe a 20 or 25 different species different species.
Some have had gone and <unk>
We've been here a few <unk> years.
It could seem like that we are very far away from other other parts of these cells the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria bacteria is used to treat it.
This is not as well as human insulin is -- that that comes is <unk>
And talking about <unk> <unk> you realize we all have in in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> is the <unk> think this?
The gut is a whole wonderful environment in <unk> for those bacteria.
It's a dark, dark, dark one.
And we're going to give them all of the nutrients that they might want to want to do with no effort effort effort.
It's really kind of go through for the bacteria to the <unk> disruption would kind to <unk>
But so, by why do we all, are we are a wonderful way to for these bacteria in the same very way they are essential to for our life. life.
They help us protect us in certain diseases.
But what are we ask the future? for us? <unk> us for what the future is us? us.
We're sort of an evolutionary balance as a species?
Or was destined to become something something a better <unk> <unk>
In this is in this whole animal kingdom, as one is one is a little grace.
That was us.
And it was also was the <unk> of this talk -- so I hope you were <unk>
When I just went to college, I had my first first first kind of biology.
I was was -- because of the elegance and the beauty is the <unk>
I fell in love with the power of that cell is is broadcast to the two cells.
But when organisms are they start things to start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something is very important thing to with that with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens is the brain is <unk> up.
In fact, one of you might say that the <unk> percent of the body is enters comes into evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I got to confess that when I was -- was a time I had more happened.
I came to understand the face of the <unk> feelings -- which was still in <unk> in in Las Vegas well come in in well in in in in her well in in in in her well in in in in well in in in <unk>
And one night does someone hits your hotel.
He opens up the door.
In front of is is a very big light dancer, <unk>
He looks at it and says, <unk> me looking for for <unk>
"He's -- say, "Okay, the <unk> <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working was for -- not only different.
I was trying to preserve the body body.
I wanted to give us healthy.
I wanted to make the health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is is to move the genome to the next is <unk> and <unk> the generation generation.
From an an evolutionary view, you all of you and I and I are as a <unk> rockets designed to the next level of <unk> and let us go to the sea.
I think that we all <unk> the feeling that I put Woody Allen I think I want to achieve the immortality through my job.
I want to be not <unk>
Evolution not necessarily treat longevity.
They don't necessarily belong to the bigger or the stronger and the stronger and the more smart smartest didn't even the most smart.
Evolution is favors the creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only one is success and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria are able to survive the fish fish fish fish, fish as fish fish fish, fish as fish fish fish, fish as they had fish.
So, what does that mean is, when we look like that is when we look like that is in the way we looked at what's going on in the evolution and we go back to thinking about in the place of humans in in the human place in in the human place in humans in in and in the time to go ahead to the <unk>
The first is one is that we didn't <unk>
We've had a whole kind of balance.
And the kind of thinking would be is that is to be is that is that we through through in first of the genes that we otherwise would have been <unk> and cut up of the population.
And secondly, as we have -- -- we have is <unk> our environment in for us as we adapt to us.
And, by by by by by by by by by by by <unk> <unk> you so much as much as possible to have the evolution happen.
One is a second possibility is that you have a form of cause a very natural evolution of the traditional kind of the traditional kind of the <unk> natural kind has to do is of the other natural type of the traditional type of the traditional type of the traditional type of the traditional type of the traditional type of the traditional type of the traditional type of the traditional
And the one is the argument are they roll very slowly, but they <unk>
And as soon as a happens, you have distant planets planets are able to be able to be producing evolution in naturally.
But there's a third possibility possibility, a possibility is a possibility of possibility a very sexy and terrifying <unk>
I call it <unk> the new evolution is not just <unk> but <unk> and for the individuals as they were <unk> <unk>
Now, how could that happen to happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, we just consider the reality that many people are people in today, in in a few culture, are making decisions like that a lot of people are today, in in are making decisions like that a lot of people have today.
In some cultures, are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily something a good good thing to you pick up at at the individual and <unk>
Think also if you were possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to choose not to choose not to be able to choose not to choose not to be able to choose not to choose not to be able to choose not to choose not to be able to choose not to choose not to be able to be able to choose not to
And if we could make the gene changes to be able to be able to do to eliminate diabetes or diabetes or <unk> or reduce the <unk>
Don't you want to do those changes in your <unk>
If we look at that the future that kind is going to be more likely as possible.
The Human Genome The Human Genome Project was the Human Genome Project, the 1990s was 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year would we have finished, in 2004, it could do the same same same same time for 20 million dollars in in in in a year or four months.
Today, you can get a full of a whole sequence of the three million billion base pairs are close to the 20,000 dollars. dollars.
There is not be much a lot to be very much so much to be able to make the human genome to you as we all of you all.
They come those changes.
The same same technology has been that is going to induce <unk> immunity.
<unk> or don't have an experimental test vaccine is in the cells in the cells in <unk> cells.
Can you just imagine something a good thing out of the <unk>
That's what today and in the future is more as you as possible.
So imagine just two other <unk> <unk>
You can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells in <unk>
And if they could change all the <unk> and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children better chance to eliminate the risk to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more children more <unk>
And then of that same same is the way the changes to prevent disease diseases are going to allow us to allow you to have <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why didn't you not have the ingenuity of <unk> <unk> all over if I was able to do is with the next generation <unk>
Why not do we have a <unk> smaller muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not do to not live even more time?
This is going to be more important.
And when we are in conditions conditions this is to the next generation and we can actually adopt the first thing in before it was in before it was.
We're going to take a a process that we could normally take a hundred a thousand years, we can actually give it up to 1,000 years and maybe happened to happen within the next hundred years.
These are the grandchildren that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are the grandchildren are are going to have to have to have to do.
We're going to use these individual choices choices choices more successful, more well.
Or, we're going to choose different different different different <unk> that we want to do for some <unk>
We're going to build a society to be more boring, and more robust or more robust or more robust is or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or and more robust and more robust and more robust is or more robust and more robust and more robust is or more robust and more
This is is the kind of question we're going to have to come in.
And most profound of all, we're are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
For good for that, before what you could <unk> these choices are choices to depend on in for us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great big when you are is to be at 900 feet tall feet height feet tall feet height feet tall feet tall height, feet tall feet tall feet height feet tall feet tall feet tall feet tall tall height, height feet tall feet tall feet tall feet tall feet tall feet tall height, feet tall feet tall feet tall feet height feet tall feet tall feet tall feet
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single single day seat, one day -- was sitting in in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about with <unk> <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and looked at them, and they said, "There's no is a problem.
The pilot was already <unk> the airplane, and we were not so far away.
You could see Manhattan.
Two things happened at the same time.
The pilot was <unk> the plane is with the Hudson River.
Generally, not the way to the way.
It takes up the motors.
Imagine being a plane and no <unk>
And then he said three words said.
The three most <unk> words have I've ever heard about.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to talk about a flight assistant.
I was able to see it in in his eyes.
It was be horror -- life was <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about that day.
I learned that it all changes in a moment.
We've got this list of things to do before they die, these things like we want to do in and didn't know all the fences I wanted to do.
As I was thinking about that, later it was me, was a <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the person is ready to be there, is going to you to open.
I don't like to do anything -- nothing in life.
And that urgency, that is that the way, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned about that day -- and this is -- that was not feel like I really feel like that.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes have tried to improve all what I did.
But in my humanity also is to give it place to my ego.
And I'm sorry the time I was going to do is in things that I didn't mind do matter.
And I thought about in my wife with my wife, with people.
And then then I decided to get rid of the negative energy energy from of my life.
It's not perfect, but much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no not try to be <unk> it will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- -- and this is like your mental watch is <unk> <unk>
You see you <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken up in the 20 pieces you look like you in that <unk>
And while I was -- I had the feeling of you -- -- will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for for the whole life. life.
But it was really sad.
I didn't love for my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in in a one thought, thought that is, is one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month was I was in in the performance performance as -- --  --  -- as a small small.
And for me, that was -- was all of the reason be in the world.
And I was able to connect to with those two points, the two points, the two points, which is matter to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is is to be a good parent.
I gave me a miracle, not not die that day.
And I gave me another one other gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back to live differently. form.
You are going to fly today, the challenge to you that to imagine that the same happens is it as it happens to you in the plane -- and please not be so ...
What are you are still expecting to do because they think they are going to live in <unk>
How would change change and the negative energy energy would change change how to change how their relationships and <unk> in in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents you to do.
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with lots of projects.
But the one was the most great thing I worked was was was was was was was was was was was was was was for this.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in <unk>
One day she came to his house to say, "Dad, I feel like a <unk> in <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> Today is you now have a full <unk> <unk>
You can only be used the eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have to have a design design and animation, so that, obviously, is we all admire and <unk> in the world.
So we decided that we decided we were going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So I went and met with her brother and father and father, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And her brother said, "I just want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
I just want to be able to be able to be able to communicate with it, and he's going to be able to communicate with it, and he's able to be able to be able to be able to be able to communicate with it, and he's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to communicate with it, and he's going to be able
And I said, "A second is not ever <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you have you important to be somebody important and you have a very good <unk>
These are <unk> are not affordable for for people."
And I said, "Well, how are you about to be?
Anybody see the movie <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, they are <unk> in the <unk>
I said, "That's a <unk> how can it be?"
So I just introduced to the only wish I was going to <unk>
And I was with her her brother and her father and her father was in there in in there at that very precise time, is we going to be going to be able to get back to be <unk>
Because it's kind of is that someone you got so much in inside in your can't <unk>
So I talked about in a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which has a technology allows to you project a light up at any surface and then with a laser laser space. space.
So they're going to make art facilities like this.
All of the things that they <unk> they say, are they part of of the things a life cycle.
They first do you start with the sexual organs, the other bad words are and the Bush and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a whole life cycle in <unk>
And so I started the journey started.
And about two two years later, about about a year later, a year to the other we had made a couple things.
One, do we touch the doors of the insurance companies, and we got to get a a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was really cool.
And seriously, is you say, "I don't <unk>
The other thing we did was was to bring seven programmers from all over the <unk>
My wife, the kids and I, and I moved to us move to the garage back and programmers and <unk> and took for <unk>
A lot of of our friends were thought to do something completely stupid and when it was <unk> would have had been taken out the boxes off the walls and in the walls and her would have <unk>
But for two two weeks, we were <unk> we went to the time tour, my child is too, and we created this.
It's called an <unk> <unk>
They are a couple of you are cheap <unk> that we bought in in the <unk> Beach, some of you guys and <unk> <unk>
We took a <unk> into the <unk> -- we set up of we set up together.
And we create a device that doesn't have no limitation doesn't really have any limitation at at all. at at all.
There is no insurance company say no.
There is no hospital that can say is say, "No."
Any person person has learned to have access to you have access to draw and contact today is have access to draw and contact you today have access to draw and contact you today have access to draw and contact you today have access to draw and contact you today have access to draw and contact you today have access to draw and contact you today have access to draw
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So at the end of the two weeks, weeks we went to the room room.
I love this picture because this is the other person and that's the room is to do.
There was all <unk> and <unk> for during the big big big <unk>
And after a more one of the more about a year of planning, two two weeks, weeks to teach him for for the first time in seven years.
And this is this is a very wonderful picture because this is is by looking through the support system system.
We ran up the bed so that I could possibly see.
And we put a a kind about on a little wall out of that the hospital out of the hospital.
And he came up to the first time in front of his family and friends you can imagine what the feeling was in the <unk>
The thing was that we had to <unk> in the parking lot, as well.
And at the end of this this sent us an email to us an email to us an email us an email to an sent us an email to us an email to send us an email to us an email to send us an email to us, a sent to send it an email to us an email to us an email to us an email to send us
I felt as well as I had had been to be under the water water, and somebody would take me out of up there so much so he could <unk>
It's not <unk>
And it's sort of our <unk>
That's what keeps us to keep us in motion, you <unk>
And we have a long way to go to with this.
It's a great thing to but is the equivalent of the <unk> <unk>
Someone with is deserve much more.
That's why are we are trying to figure out how to do it better, and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've ever had all sorts of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, is <unk> none of you is is doing with this.
Everything goes out of our own pockets.
The <unk> were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong was <unk> something about about in and then, in in in <unk>
The best thing about that -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this is what ends the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> <unk>
<unk> is going to be in the show which is what is pretty impressive.
So, basically is the one is my idea: if if you look like it as possible.
Nothing is in in this room was was possible -- the <unk> the microphone, nothing was in possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> any thing in this room.
I'm not never did anything with <unk> technology technology -- just recognized that as I was <unk> me with with very wonderful <unk>
And these are these are the questions who I want to do that we all do I want to do that we all do I want to do that we all do I want to do that we all do that I want to do that we all do we all do that we all do that I want to do that we all do we all do that we
Thank you. guys.
I've spent the last last few years years in in in in in in in situations in in situations in in at the same same time a little dangerous. dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in in a <unk> mine mine worked in in in a <unk> mine mine worked in in in a <unk> mine mine worked in in in a <unk> mine mine worked in in in a <unk> mine mine worked in in in a <unk> mine mine worked on in in a <unk> mine mine worked in in in in a <unk> mine mine worked on in in in
It's in the areas are hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days, we eating just -- a fun thing to at the end.
In fact, in a big part of my career I've been -- have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have been to have
So when I knew that was come in here to do a whole TEDTalk over the world and <unk> wanted to do something a little bit different.
So, some of you may have heard for, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took a a <unk>
And I sent some messages on on Facebook, some of you at the name of my name is from my name of my TED TEDTalk of the behalf of at 2011.
What was that was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But he said that, is is a very good opportunity opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's is a title in progress, by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by
So I was knew that somebody was going to buy the support of the name.
If I would have been asked me a year ago, I was not been able to put with certainty.
But in the time I film is where I'm working on, the <unk> world for <unk>
And I as I said earlier, I've been in in before I've been in in before I've been in in before I've been in in before I've been in in before I've been in in before I've been in in before I was in in before I was in in before I was in in before I was in in before I was in in before I've been in in
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> <unk> I want I want to make an <unk> of <unk>
The film is how is you going to call the largest largest <unk> film is going to be called the <unk>
What happens is before the title -- the <unk> that comes before the title is.
Now this is a brand, -- <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people are <unk> in the time to <unk> it forever.
And so the film is exploring the whole idea is -- <unk> <unk> is <unk>
I am I am -- -- <unk> only the <unk> was more well.
She was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X X of you in in in the title of the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe they <unk> a shoe and becomes the most great shoe you might have happened.
The biggest car is you had <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is the idea is is to you have -- the idea is as well to show the brands as a part is <unk>
The target aim is is is is is is is is is is is is is is to do.
You'll all see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea -- all the <unk> in the beginning to end.
And I would love you to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny -- because it's the first time I hear of it -- is -- is is -- is -- is is -- is is -- is -- is is -- is -- is is -- is is -- is -- is is -- is -- is is -- is is -- is -- is is -- is -- is is -- is is -- is
<unk> I don't don't know how <unk> it is going to be the people to do.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- -- not -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- not -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
MS: A million and a half and a half million and a half million a half million and a half million a half and a half million a half and a half million and a half million a half million and a half million a half and a half million and a half million -- a half million and a half million and a half million and a half million
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time to go to the time we go to the time to go to the time we go to the time to go to the time we go to the time to go to the time we go to the time to go to the time we go to the time to go to the time we go to the time that comes to
MS: What do you think this is going to be the answer?
It's Stuart <unk> most answers are going to be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to be in <unk> by the film or for <unk>
JK: So forth.
MS: <unk>
So, I <unk> I need a help.
MK: So I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what <unk>
MS: Yes. <unk> That is when you look like that <unk>
MK: We've got some places where I go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: And I thought -- <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation out.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about in <unk>
MS: And this was -- one -- -- for all of all of a sudden a sudden has disappeared.
None of have nothing to do with this film.
I was really surprised me.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was really got to think that the concept is as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of this intersection of the media and old media and the <unk> scenario is is not tell you about that is to tell with that new body is worth <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was this one.
It wasn't really not, there was not be such a mistake.
There was not be at at all.
This would have been good.
But the problem was what is that represent this this image.
See, when you look for <unk> in Google <unk>
I like your way for <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can already -- heard a lot about a lot about transparency in these days.
Our <unk> the <unk> the <unk> even <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly it really changes all changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives it <unk>  like that weird bear is still yet.
It's just <unk>  as this is strange <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What's other thing to be?
<unk> an entire bowl of <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started to talk to the companies and tell you that we wanted to do is to be <unk> <unk>
We want to make it a story -- but <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid and my father is <unk> me in staring at as I used to say, <unk> are three in staring at as he was -- said, "Son, is you looking at as I used to say, <unk> there is three in staring at as he was -- said, "Son, is you looking at as he used to say, <unk> are three in staring at the
Is it is is -- is is is -- is is is -- is is -- is is -- is -- is is is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is my story, the one is the story is and there's the <unk> story.
As you can see, we wanted to tell the real story. history.
But only one is a company, a one would you have to take the person to have was <unk>
So what I started to warn you, the idea is it's a universal problem. problem.
MS: So I've got friends to make a big, giants and other things like my own.
And my friends who do these are do movies in Hollywood movies <unk> they say that the reason that their movies is because of you must have the brands marks you have to have.
And then my friends who are they are going to compete with these big, giant <unk> films.
And the movie is is called the largest largest <unk> of the film.
How are we go to <unk> in the movie?
Every every time I am is to go out, every time I open my <unk> will you see the <unk> <unk>
At all at the time I had someone else can I say good good for this <unk>
You're ready? -- you all look a little bit nervous.
I want to help you <unk> you.
Maybe you just put you a little bit before it before you before the <unk> before.
And there was one of one of these <unk> <unk>
Both are <unk> like you as <unk> the <unk> are going to have a chance.
We're going to have so much a man like to be <unk> to <unk>
That's the big look large.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen 1: We are a little brand.
So let's go the kind of of the smaller films you <unk> are more well a brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget out of have other <unk>
So I do things like this, you know, you really interested in us.
MS: What words would you used to describe <unk> <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: Now. That's a big big question.
Woman: higher.
MS: Technology is not the way to you want to describe something to you like to describe something that you kind is put in in <unk>
Man: We talk about something very smart, cool.
I think you <unk> is is a great word that it really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you fresh better, more <unk> more <unk> a better <unk>
Things like you <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's one is a <unk> company.
What about me? What are there are a <unk>
I need to talk to the man man -- to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand <unk>
MS: So how are they define their <unk> in <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good good.
Volunteer: revive are less as it is <unk>
MS: All right, well, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> something is -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
I like you very much dark colors, many gray and things like this.
They usually conduct accessories like the <unk> or <unk>
Woman: if if Dan was be a brand one could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The mark that makes you call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part part are in the <unk> part of two: I don't know.
Man 3: I'm just the kind of pet pet am. I am.
They <unk> toys for <unk> in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand brand ...
My <unk> is my brand <unk>
Man 4: My brand is by the <unk>
Man 5: Nation impacts, have failed.
Is that is, anything?
<unk> I'm a brand a lawyer.
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, it's not all of you can have a brand brand a brand of us to be in at the intersection of <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed a an expert.
I needed somebody could go into my head, someone who could help me to understand what the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped their companies like <unk> <unk> <unk>
If they were able to do for them, they could surely they could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first first picture is is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a kind of relate to your thoughts and feelings of you are.
MS: These are people to shape my way to see the world.
Tell me about that world world.
MS: That world is I think your world is in the world that we used to you, your friends, your family are you live in life, the work that you are.
All of these things are and start in a place and in my family, West Virginia.
A: what is the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is this one was the best day in life."
Well how do we relate this to your thoughts, feelings of the way to be?
MS: It is like I want to be.
I like things like things.
I like -- I like things like things like things like that.
Tell me out of the <unk> what is we use to us?
What is you are in right now?
Why is it be <unk> what is the <unk> for <unk>
Tell me a very little bit about about that.
A little bit more about -- that is not be you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be happy, what kind has are you? are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: <unk> for you for for your <unk> Great <unk> -- -- very much.) -- very much.)
MS: Yes, I don't know what it is going to go about this.
There was so crazy in all of this.
<unk> <unk> -- the first first thing I saw was was was this was this is that is that there are two different sides but <unk>
They <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost almost an paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong dots or in the other instead rather focus on in both.
A lot of companies tend -- -- -- -- -- and it is to prevent the things that they're not <unk> to avoid the things that they are not <unk> to avoid the things that you're not <unk> to avoid the things that you're not <unk> to avoid the things that you're not <unk> to avoid the things that you're not <unk> to avoid the things that you're not <unk>
What other brands is like this?
The first is the first here is is is is is the Apple <unk> first is the first first one.
And you can also see you <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now there are all kinds of <unk> those things that you have been and come up and -- is is something quite powerful.
MS: A whole brand <unk> what is you <unk>
If someone gets you to take your your brand new brand your brand, your brand, your brand, your brand, your brand, what would be? would be?
Are you a somebody who makes blood you get.
Or are you rather be more well as a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are the <unk> attributes is as being as a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or are you are more well in <unk>
You're very <unk> <unk>
You are are you <unk> you <unk>
You are you good good, family family -- like the Dalai hears <unk>
In the course of this film was over to 500 businesses, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have nothing to do with anything to do with anything to do with this film, mostly you -- would not have control about the final product. product.
They allowed us to tell you the story of <unk> and we got to tell the story of that the story is how to identify the desire centers in such as it is.
We went to St. Paulo where you banned the advertising in the air.
In the city over for the last five years, there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are companies getting available in the U.S. problems.
The thing was the amazing thing to me is that the projects have had the most most more success to be the ones that I've been dealing with with things directly.
And that's what is what they did these brands. did is do?
He took to the <unk> took to the <unk> they took to their <unk> and said maybe you not have my best best in better in in in in mind.
I'm going to directly directly to the an artist.
I'm going to work with it to create something a different thing to something something is going to challenge the way we looked at the world.
And how do it has gone? has been gone? <unk>
Well, since the movie was sent out, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> let's look a look. look.
In <unk> the movie was published, in January, -- and this film.
This is just about a whole time period period.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not still <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this is have already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because of almost all of the agencies agencies that we ever talked about it to their clients is not a part.
I always believed that if you are <unk> if you take a risks, that you may have an opportunities.
I think when you get people pushing for failure.
I think that when you trained their employees in <unk> at the risk is preparing all of their company into for <unk>
I feel like what has to happen to move forward is is is that we have to encourage people in <unk>
We have to encourage people that it is not be afraid of in the people who they can <unk> them.
Ultimately, we will -- I think we have to be about to the fear.
We've got to put that bear in in a cage in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk> the risk.
From an <unk> we need we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, have we have to harbor our transparency. have we have to harbor transparency. we have to harbor demand is transparency.
Today it's just go to go a long long way.
And I said that, to the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data data is in opportunities for companies to do.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: do we come in the name that that happened is exactly the <unk>
MS: That's a remarkable question.
In my pocket -- I have got a a check to name.
The idea is the idea of the <unk> <unk> is actually really very simple.
We don't want to get to get the nuclear bomb bomb.
Her biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is is in <unk>
The gray boxes that you can you see are are in control control in real time.
If we were able to engage these these systems systems that they are controlled speeds and <unk> and a lot of problems you are.
The gray boxes don't do are not a technology completely different technology.
But if we are we got a back an <unk> gray, so we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
<unk> walk up to the <unk> the <unk> mission.
It's just <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we began to do research on <unk> it six months ago, the purpose was purpose, the purpose was the purpose was the purpose was be totally unknown.
The only thing you knew is is is that it's really be is that is that it's be very, very very complex about in the <unk> part the <unk> used multiple <unk> think.
It seemed like to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to do something with these <unk> these systems systems.
That was really called us to us -- and we started an experiment in that that was with this happen.
So they were very strange.
<unk> it was as well as as a a single likes of the lab doesn't like like -- -- -- -- but was not wanted to eat.
I didn't make sense of sense for me.
And after I experimenting with different different flavors to the time to you know, -- this is be a <unk>
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actually working on <unk>
If it doesn't, <unk> does nothing.
So that I called my attention, and we started working work at -- -- don't know what the <unk> is.
It might -- -- say, for a example, a power plant in the U.S. energy in the United States, or a chemical energy plant in in Germany.
So best you would better go to the time soon.
So we pulled up to the attack, the attack code, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs.
We also saw that there were were very skilled armed armed with people who obviously had all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have all of have
You are all of you to attack.
You probably even know how much they <unk> the the <unk> the operator.
So they know that.
And if you have heard about the <unk> it is is is is is is is is be very much.
It's very much above all we've seen before.
Here's an code of attack.
We are talking about about about a thousand thousand lines
It looks like the old old language.
I want to tell you how we could we find sense of a sense of sense.
So what was we were looking for at the beginning was to be was calls to the functions function because we know what they do.
And then we were were we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried it to be with <unk> with the real real world. world.
We need to have theories about how we can we can pass or <unk>
To be in order to be in order to be aware that it is is definitely be a <unk> white <unk> must be a white <unk>
They don't have several thousands of targets in the area.
It is basically be cut up to the <unk> nuclear power plant <unk> and the <unk> coal-fired plant, <unk>
So I was told my <unk> a <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> in <unk>
I called them at them in them in the <unk> effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in and data.
And it worked pretty good.
So we were able to were able to have was with the little little digital <unk> digital <unk> the digital <unk> digital with the control of the <unk> the <unk> of the digital <unk> digital <unk> with you the control of the <unk> control.
rotor is is that a cell in inside the <unk> is that black is you see.
If we run the speed of you -- certainly you can <unk> and even make the <unk> it explodes.
What we also saw is the end is that the goal goal was to make it slow in -- in an obvious effort to be going to be going to be slow at in in an obvious effort to go back to the <unk> <unk> so they couldn't not solve this quickly.
We are trying to figure out the big digital <unk> big is looking very close to the data data.
So, for for example, the number is <unk> it is not be <unk> up.
So I started to do research literature on about how they are <unk> are <unk> in in <unk> and found that they are <unk> in the <unk> and found that they are <unk> are <unk> in what it is call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, had a coincidence.
And it was better at all.
These are <unk> in Iran -- are in <unk> in the 15 different parts of called stages.
And guess what do we find in <unk>
It's a almost amount of structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This was given a very much trust trust understanding what we had in with our hands.
It wasn't like it like this.
The results have been to have been to be after a several weeks weeks of days.
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
We still found that both of these both <unk> the digital digital <unk> were pointed to a single single other <unk> are <unk>
The little little <unk> is taking a <unk> and <unk> and big <unk> is <unk>
We are very confident that we've determined at that we've determined that we have certain is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about some other targets targets to you for <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things we showed, really was <unk> me.
There's the dark box and up the top <unk>
What is the thing does is to intercept the values values for for the sensors for for the vibration sensors, which is still run during during the attack with with false data.
And believe it or not, these are these are <unk> <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during during the <unk> security is feeds in <unk>
Is it a great huh?
The idea is the idea is not only be <unk> the <unk> in the middle of the control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is a <unk> a digital security system.
We need to do that we need digital security systems where could not act fast.
For example, in a large power plant is <unk> -- you have got to open escape valves.
Obviously, this is not do that a human operator,
That's where we need to do is that we need digital security systems for you.
And when you're <unk> then you can do bad things.
The plant can <unk>
And we don't have the <unk> nor the security system is <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What is I'm going to say is is really important.
Think about this. This is a <unk>
It has nothing nothing to do, specifically be <unk> with <unk>
Could it work too, for in an energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you have not <unk> which to disseminate this is with a <unk> key <unk> is we just seen in the case of the <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology technology technology to do that for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if we made that, you <unk> is with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the highest number of the targets is for such is is not be in in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All of the green areas are are with large spaces spaces in them.
We need to deal the consequences and better than we are in our way to do is now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have got a question.
<unk> has been made in a lot of sides that people assumes that the <unk> is is in behind the other.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK. really do you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is is that the <unk> is <unk> but the engine is is not be <unk>
The engine is of this is is is the <unk> superpower do.
There is be alone, -- and that's the United States, fortunately, is <unk>
Because our problems are to be even larger.
CA: Thank you, by <unk> thank you, <unk>
I want to imagine a robot that you can actually take you to be able to imagine a robot that can you be able to be able to give up and give you to raise you up and go to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots <unk>
They're not nothing different than something you put in in in the morning, it gives you a great force that is also increased is to give you increase for <unk>
It's actually what the man and the machine.
But not just do it integrate and it was connected to with the universe and with other other other things to do.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So I can actually show in what we are working on to talk about the American soldier which is on on average, it has got to be on on the back of a <unk> load load to it.
Obviously, this leads to some of these major complications injuries <unk>
We decided to look at at at and create a process of a challenge and creating a <unk> which could help you manage the matter.
Let me introduce you the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: A can I be <unk> 90 pounds in for for for for for for a whole different time.
Their <unk> can you put up in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> movements can you put up in <unk> <unk> and run the movements are <unk>
I will what I want to do, or where do I want to go, and -- my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're all ready, with our industrial <unk>
I mean, it's actually a reality.
So let's go back now the way to the views of the wheels -- about what I'm really feel particularly passionate about.
There are have been <unk> million people roughly, in in the world chairs.
Like one one percent one percent percent one percent one percent.
And this is this is a really very conservative calculation
We talk about something that happens is with a very different way and the people are very young people who are very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very young people very
We are also talking about the population that is aging is <unk> very quickly.
Their only person was often -- -- is a <unk> wheelchair.
And this is for the last 500 years, as I must recognize.
So we decided that we decided to start by writing a new chapter about about about about about about about about about about about to do.
Let me to introduce you the <unk> which is is using <unk> the one who was <unk> was a <unk> <unk> years ago.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: is using our <unk> which we <unk>
It has a few <unk>
It was completely <unk> in on the next back.
There are also do is with this a soft and very wild.
I was was 24 at at the top of my life when, in when, by <unk>
In a second of a second, I lost whole whole sensation and all of you all was all of and all of you all and all of you all and all of you all and all of you all and all of you all and all of you all and all of you all and all of you all and all of you all and all of you and all
Shortly after that, a doctor went to my room in the hospital to me, <unk> will never come up to <unk>
That was happened about 19 years ago.
So I stole up up to the last last single day of hope is.
<unk> technology has been allowed me to learn about <unk> it costs me to learn how to <unk> it climb rocks and even riding <unk>
But they have not invented anything to me to walk up until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, have the technology -- we have the technology -- we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's all in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future future future generations, you all.
AB: Thank you.
I just went back from a a community that has the secret human survival has got the secret to have. survival.
It's a place where women women women got the <unk> practice sex for saying hello, and the game is is is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the <unk> festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, are you know about their cousins.
This is the world of <unk> wild of <unk> in the Congo.
<unk> are along with the chimpanzees, their living living relatives, family.
That means we all share is a common ancestor, that was about six million years ago.
Now the chimpanzees are they known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, is we unfortunately, we have just too focused very focused on in this aspect of in our narratives look like in in our narratives of that looks in in our aspect of our narratives look like this in our narratives of that looks in in our relative to our narratives look in in our narratives of that that looks like in in our narratives of the human human
But the bonobo show us the other side side to the other currency.
Whereas if the chimpanzees are chimps are Bonobo is in charge of the <unk>
These guys have guys created something very special -- this because this leads to the mortal violence where mortal violence are not ever observed.
But unfortunately, is unfortunately, are the least be the least <unk> <unk>
They live in in the depths of <unk> and it's been very hard for <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> a land of extraordinary -- but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of <unk> <unk>
No is no wonder that this is will also put in in the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade trade hunting are they are made it to not fill a <unk> stadium with <unk>
However, in in this land of violence and violence as we hidden in the trees.
Who are these guys <unk>
We have we know them as the romantic apes apes love, love, love, is because they have sex -- are frequent <unk> <unk> in to manage the conflict conflicts to solve are.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problem are because the <unk> are <unk>
By <unk> as humans, they love to play with throughout their entire life. life.
Play is not just be a play game. game.
For us, and for them the game is is fundamental to create connections and encourage <unk>
With him learn -- and learn the rules of play.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of the diversity of diversity in diversity and diversity and diversity of behaviors, of connections.
And when you look at the game, you see the same sharp root roots you Bonobo you look like it and the <unk> and human ritual are the human narrative. Sea.
The game is is is the glue that comes together. us.
I don't know what you got to do, but I want to show you a couple of the wild media.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I'm not not talk about <unk>
Here we have is a female and young young female <unk> in the middle of them.
Look at what she is.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of you -- -- has <unk>
I just think that in this case is to him, is not?
Yeah.
So that is how much is play is as much in a human as in humans.
And this is this video is really interesting to because we were <unk> this is really is really interesting to because it shows the science to you as -- like -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like -- -- like the <unk>
But the game is is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can actually adopt a lot of ways -- some of which you can ask for.
And I want to do is -- this is a <unk> a young woman young young female <unk> in playing with <unk> water.
I think that, as we sometimes we played in their own, and we explore the boundaries of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's really playful that that drives us to go to explore, go to interact. the one is us to go to explore, go to explore, go to explore, go to explore, go to explore, go into the <unk>
These are these are just small samples of the understanding that the Bonobo is in and present to us.
But they also have a future you need to our future, a future is we have to adapt to a more more more harder you need to do.
The secret is is is the point is the key is the key is is is the key is is is the key is is the key is is the key is is is the key is is is the key is is the key is is is the key is is is the key is is the key is is is the key is is is the key is
In other words, the game is is is is to be our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world to a world that changes us have to play.
But we will go back to our peak our our ability capacity for for you to do.
The game is not <unk>
The game is is is is is to do.
For human and humans the life is not just <unk> and <unk>
When it looks like the least least good thing to play, can actually be the times as we can do.
And so we had a colleagues are to accept this this gift of <unk> the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York am I am in in in New York am I am is in in in in -- is in in in in the whole is -- is in in in the whole is -- is in in in this -- is in in in the whole time is in New York am in the time is in the non-profit and <unk> called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, be a fires as a captain of the captain volunteers.
And in our city where are volunteers are faced with a very <unk> site in soon to get into action.
I remember my first first <unk>
I was was just a little chance pretty high go.
But yet there was a foot to the other other others to you to get in the other back to the others that we was doing this.
When I came to <unk> it was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that we would certainly go through for one of the world's worst lives.
We were in in the night, she was standing out of standing outside in the rain, in in in in in in in in in in her in in her in her in in her in her in in her in her in her in her in her in her in her in her in in her in her in her in her in her in her in her in
The other volunteer I had just got before I am, -- -- -- -- -- -- -- was first to the to the captain and asked him to walk in and save the dog access.
The <unk> was <unk>
There was be a <unk> <unk> lawyer would have to tell the people that I got into in a <unk> building to save you for for for for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain did me a <unk>
He said, <unk> do I need you need to go to the home.
I need you <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring it to this woman a <unk>
I <unk>
It was not exactly what I was expected to do, but <unk> I got on the stairs, in the end of the hall, it went to the more tall had had just finished and off the fire and walked into the <unk>
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a a hero.
I took my burden back down the ladder to where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog would <unk>
We came up from the house to the <unk> to the <unk> in which is to wait, her treasure a got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department had a letter got a <unk> to save their home.
And the <unk> that she was looked at about in the other thing was that someone had had to have had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both of you in my <unk> in Robin <unk> like in my so-called <unk> as a volunteer will I witness and <unk> in the individual level.
And you know what I've learned? I learned?
Everything has is.
So, when I look at in this room to people who have achieved, or they're going to be able to be made remarkable levels of success as I would like not to remind you -- this:
Don't wait for winning the first first <unk> to make a difference a difference is to make the difference a difference is to make the difference
If you have something to give you <unk> now.
We got food in a dining room, <unk> a <unk> park <unk>
mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save your lives but every day are we be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
So I trained the <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem a strange, big big fan of the concrete concrete.
The first concrete blocks was built in in <unk> with a very whole fixed measure that fit fit together.
Very quickly, are these became a <unk> unit unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these are all have become on the top of the time.
About a hundred years later, in in in in the years later, in in in in in in the years later, in in in in in in the years later, in in in in in in the years later, in in in in in in the years later, in the years came up.
It was actually called a <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It is have been estimated that they've been made over over more than a billion or 75 bricks by every person on on the planet.
You don't have an engineer to build in beautiful buildings or homes.
<unk> it made it accessible.
<unk> I just adopted the general block block the <unk> the world in the world, and it became a very fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, it is exactly the same same year, in the year, the next was a time to <unk> the new new new block of construction.
The transistor was the whole was <unk>
Just like the particular block block the <unk> allows allows you to create circuits much greater and more much more much more much more much more complex and more complex and more complex is more complex than it like that.
But there's a <unk> difference the transistor was was just for experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks blocks blocks to the experts, so I decided that I decided to change it.
And eight years ago, when I was at at at at the the Media Media was with this, began to have the power of the power to the hands and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk> years now.
I'm going to show you how to work.
<unk> are each other modules into each of you with a specific function. function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound engines and sensors.
And the best thing better about it is is is is that they are put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together they together put together these together
So they can't actually put in a wrong way.
The <unk> have a color code.
The green is is the <unk> the blue is and the orange is is the input and orange is is the wire.
So we just can just assemble a blue with you and very quickly can you start to make the major circuits program.
A blue is with green in green you green with you green in green you green with green you green you green you is with light.
Can we put a a button into and we have a <unk> button.
If we move the <unk> button for a pulse, which is a pulse, what's a <unk> light.
We <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and a noise.
I'm just going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, are they are really very powerful.
Instead of have I can program, to connect us to do with using very simple <unk>
To do it <unk> faster or <unk> it just is a button to be more fast or slower.
The idea is that is that be a <unk> collection is in is is that it is be a <unk> collection.
We want to do we want all the interactions in the world goes on to the <unk> interactions in the world.
<unk> <unk> solar panels, it all happen everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is it is to understand the electronics in every day you don't learn in in schools.
For example, how is an iPod does is matter.
We've also pushed <unk> to the design schools.
So, for example, the designers have some electronic designers start to start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see here -- you have <unk> bottles and <unk>
<unk> <unk> -- a few weeks ago, we took a <unk> to the <unk> Island School did not have some experience experience.
Here's an example of a a project that you've done, have done, a barrel is <unk>
But wait, here's the one is my favorite project.
It's a a <unk>
For these are not not engineers, of <unk> became another other one other material.
And we want we want to do that is all the way to all of us.
And <unk> has an open source.
You can go to the page, you can go all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a whole world and inventors and collaborators because this is where we live, this is our interactive world.
So forward to make things.
Thank you.
Today I'm just about unexpected unexpected discoveries. today.
I work in the solar industry industry.
And my little company is to be involved with with the environment is to get involved in with the environment.
<unk> collaboration can collaboration are collaboration are collaboration are distributed collaboration
This is a small video clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can just take a little bit a little bit apart.
We <unk> can we continue better at one side to the time.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is is is ...
Oh, I just go the time at the time.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an an launched an launched an launched a year to work in in an environment environment that represents are we ask for them to work for.
The initiative was as a <unk> <unk> to <unk>
We got some members every year and we put them working on with the <unk>
Instead we get them in the Third World World we send them the <unk> world.
They made great big <unk> worked worked on with <unk>
Your job is is to show the possibilities of the current technology. technology.
Meet <unk>
And it's a a <unk> in the city in Boston.
Here it is as if I looked for a <unk> but what does it really look for is that is that someone has got to do is when you got caught up by by the snow because you know it's not really good by turning up with a meter in when it is is.
How did it come to be asking the help in the way so <unk>
Last year, we had a team of <unk> for <unk> for <unk>
They were there in there in February -- and at the time we were going to spend a long last year.
They realized the city had never wiped out of these <unk>
But one of the members called the members called called Erik <unk> I noticed something more -- that citizens had to go with with these little citizens in <unk> up with the sidewalks right in in front of them.
So I did as well as a good good developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can you take for a <unk>
You hold up at when you were <unk>
And when I did that, you got a name, in this is in this case it was <unk>
If you don't, somebody can <unk>
So it has a whole component component is.
It's a very modest application.
Maybe it is the smallest 21 applications will <unk> last year.
But something is something that no else does not have any other technology in <unk>
And this is spread out there.
One is for the citizens to <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> to work.
So he asks the citizens to <unk> them.
And then Seattle decided he decided to use it to make the citizens in <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just throw people up to the time to <unk>
So we now do we know about nine cities as we plan to use this.
And this is and spread out not <unk> in a natural way.
If you know about a little government technology would you know that this is not normally happen.
The software can usually takes a couple of years. years.
Last year we had a team working on for for two and a half <unk>
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school in for children.
Then they were told that the fact made for the normal things was done by for the normal channels were at least two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a one project is in the power power of dollars and doesn't work.
And there are these projects like this in every level of the government.
So an one is an app that shows you in a couple days and it spreads it into is is a kind of take warning for the institution of for <unk>
It suggests the government to be better think it should be.
Neither is a kind of a technological company, the <unk> but more well as the one's the Internet. itself.
That is to say, <unk> in an open form and <unk>
And that's what is important.
But what's more important of this is is that represents a way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> is not like a problem with not be a problem with a collective action. problem.
And that's what turns out that we are are really good for for collective technology. technology.
And there's a very big community community of people who is building together the tools to work together to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there's hundreds of people in all of the days in their own communities.
They haven't been giving up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to before it doesn't <unk> you <unk>
And this is people know something that we have we lost in sight.
And that is that if we just leave the feelings of you are things about -- because we were alone yet.
Now a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are people are going to ask you to be asked you to do it -- because the things are things are.
The politics don't <unk> the government is yes.
And because the one is the way to make change change.
I didn't not know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to give them <unk>
Well, after I was two years I've come to the conclusion that the conclusion was conclusion that the government is is, mostly about <unk>
This is is the center of care care care care service and information.
It's the place that serves the calls are if you got to be in <unk> in the U.S. percent.
Scott <unk> this <unk>
<unk> <unk> at the base of <unk> <unk>
I didn't know nothing that it started with animal control.
And he was finally said, "Hey, can you open the door doors to make you very good and see if they <unk>
And it worked.
But that was not be the end of the <unk> them.
Boston is not have a telephone center.
It has got a <unk> and cell and <unk> a <unk>
You don't do that app.
It was work out that was the work of the work of people in the New American <unk> <unk> in Boston.
One of the day, this is actually comes up in this -- it comes up in -- it comes up in -- this is actually comes up with this -- put in on in my <unk> <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> <unk> is different different.
Scott was talking about in person.
In <unk> -- all is is -- all is are you all have to see this.
In this case, it was saw him a neighbor. either.
The next next one was say, "I <unk>
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned out the <unk> and I went home.
Good night, sweet <unk> <unk>
Pretty much.
This is really cool. -- is the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also is a great example of the government income to the income income is income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is the income income is
But it's also a great example of have a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the technological technology technology is.
I am talking about a platform for that people are people going to be aware of and help others.
So, a one is a citizen helped to do that, but the government had was a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And I might have been able to connected to the government service services that we need to do, but your neighbor is one better and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor is help to be <unk> the communities.
If we call it over of the animals, that costs a much money out of money.
One is a big thing we need to think about the government is is that is not be the same same same same same same thing is politics.
A lot of people do it, do -- but is think of the input to be.
That is that our input is to the government is that our input is is is is a vote.
So how many times have they have chosen to be a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose our values and <unk> our values are.
That is because of the government is it's like a huge ocean and politics is is is the surface of <unk>
So underneath is you what we call <unk> <unk>
And we say that word with so much.
But it's is that <unk> what is that holds us as something something that works against that is -- that is something else, and we are actually missing the power. like that is to do.
People think that policy is is sexy.
If we want this institution to work out, have to be able to have to be able to be able to have to be able to have to do is to do we have to be going to have to be able to have to do is to have to be able to have to do is to do we have to be going to have to be able to
Because it's where is the real real people real work happens. happen.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes is the <unk> movement.
They've been <unk> them.
It's a whole group of citizens worried they have written a very detailed set of citizens who was worried about that they have written a very detailed <unk> report on for <unk>
That's not not activism in <unk>
And for the ones that we have to ask us to leave you to our children. our children.
You have to see the big challenges that they will have to come in.
Do you really believe that we going to go to where we need to go to the name that you can act in behalf of the name of all?
We can't do it for <unk> we need it to be more effective.
The good news is is that the technology is possible to rethink the government function of the way it can expand to a civil society. function of so it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation of you have a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not be so hard to put in the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is in the way so many of them.
This is is a generation that has grown up, taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all are we all have to <unk> are all going to talk about.
They can express their views in any same time at at the same same time, and they do.
So when we are facing the government don't you really much care about to be able to hear your voices.
They're just using their hands. hands.
They bring the hands to the work to make a work work better in government.
And those are those applications are allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking a <unk> <unk> inside.
We were always been able to have cleaned that <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these are these applications are as we are the U.S. consumers consumers are consumers as we are in the government consumers consumers in the government consumers consumers we are in the government consumers consumers are we are the consumers consumers consumers who we are in the government consumers consumers are we are consumers in the government consumers consumers as we are in the government consumers consumers are we are
We are more than that. are we as well.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't make the citizen to it.
So I want to be asking all of all of you all of you -- when it is about the other things important we need to do together, we are going to are going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, and death as is in the prisons to death.
I've spent most of my life in in <unk> communities in in projects in in and places in where there is so much despair. despair.
And I'm just looking at and hearing is that has given to have given a lot of energy.
One is one of the things that I ever noticed in this is is is is that is that TED is is is is is is is is is that TED you have to have TED is about in in is is is that is that TED is is is is is is is is is is that TED you have to have TED is about in in is is
And the things are the things that you are told here is to impact all over the world.
On occasion, it makes you a sense sense of it has a sense of sense a sense of sense sense of a sense of sense it has a sense sense of a sense of sense of make a sense of make a sense of sense sense of sense it has a sense of sense a sense of sense sense of a sense of sense it has a sense sense of
I say this because I think identity is is to be <unk>
Here we have seen these fantastic exoskeletons.
And I think that we have learned that the words can you have a lot of sense, but they teach them to feel a special meaning box.
A can do good things -- if you <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't have learned that in in the right, my job. work.
I was learned about it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house house in dominated by one <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was -- it -- it was -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- was -- it -- it -- it -- it -- was -- it -- it -- it -- was -- it -- it -- it -- it -- was -- it -- it -- it -- was -- it --
It was -- was the last word in all of in a discussion discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
He was was a daughter of people who had been to be slaves. slaves.
Her parents were born in in slavery in Virginia in Virginia about in Virginia about <unk> in Virginia about in Virginia about in Virginia about <unk> in Virginia about in Virginia about with the <unk>
She was born about <unk> and his experience was the world looks at the world.
She was a hard way, but also was <unk>
When I was was -- I looked at him, her, was me close to me -- she was going close to her, she was looked at him, she was close to me, was to me -- was me close to me -- she was approaching me -- was to me -- was me close to me, was me close to me -- she was going close to it, she was
I <unk> so hard that I could barely breathe and breathe to me <unk>
One or two or two or two to me -- -- still feel like you feel like you <unk>
And if I was told that no, they <unk> me again to you <unk> it was again <unk> and if I was told that yes, I stopped me in peace.
I had this human quality that would you always want to be close to the <unk>
The only problem is is is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower lower <unk>
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not be easy to be able to take care of your time.
My cousins were all over the parts.
I remember when I was eight, a nine years old, I woke up one in a morning, and they were all of my cousins.
My was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was was a game.
So I looked at her and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 -- or 20 minutes, minutes, she got up, up the room and said, "Come to me, and <unk>
I remember this as it was was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll just tell you something a <unk>
I said, "Okay, okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> the <unk> I said, <unk>
And then I sat down, me look at me to me, and said, "I want to know you have been you to be <unk> at you.
And <unk> "I think are you are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just just like me -- three things -- <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And said, "The first first thing I want to do is to me, is that we always want to get me <unk> is that you always want to do is to me -- is you always want to do is to me -- is you always want your <unk> you always want to do.
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that the <unk> always is.
As I <unk> my <unk> I said, "Yes, <unk> so much.
And then she was said to me, "The second thing I want to do is to me -- is you always do the right thing to be.
I thought to him, and I was like, "Yeah, <unk>
Then, finally, he was finally said, <unk> the third thing I want to do is to me -- is that you <unk> <unk>
I was I was nine years old, -- and I said, "Yes, <unk> so much.
I grew up in the country in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in the middle <unk> I have a year a little year.
When I was --  15, one day my brother came home to us.
We just just got to do the <unk> anyway.
He took a a sip of beer, he offered a little foot to me.
I said, "No, no, no.
My brother was said, <unk> Today is you just do the same same same thing we are.
I already took something -- your sister -- -- a <unk>
I was like, "No. I wouldn't feel good.
Then my brother did I stare at me at me not <unk> at me not <unk> at me.
And he said, "What is you going? take a <unk>
I went to the <unk> look me and says, "Ah, not not be thinking about in <unk>
I said, "What are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren who grandchildren are to do.
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you for before you to do.
I'll tell you something that probably should not say.
I know this is spread very <unk>
But I have to be able to admit that I never did is or a drop of alcohol.
I'm not say that as a <unk> I am --  <unk>
When we did the kind of kind we say things like to the other things they didn't look like this.
We can't get to do things that you don't think to do.
I think that my naturally thought to believe that all of their grandchildren believed were were really special.
My grandfather had had been a prisoner for during the <unk>
My died died of diseases have died of <unk> diseases have died of <unk> diseases
And these were these were all the things that we were, in it, we should have got to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal criminal justice system system.
This country is today today today is today about what it was for 40 years now.
In <unk> there were 300,000 there were 300,000 guys.
Today is there are in 2.3 million.
In the United States have the biggest incarceration care in the world.
We have seven million people in in probation.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has changed our world.
In poor or black, are so much <unk> as much despair, for for these facts.
One was in the three black men in between the 18 and the 30 is in the age and the 30 is in the age and the 30 is in the age and the 30 is in the age and the 30 is in the age and the 30 is in the age and the 30 is in the age and the 30 is in the age and the 30
In the urban <unk> in all the country, Los Angeles, L.A., Baltimore -- 50 -- 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60
Our system is also about to poverty.
In this country, we have a a country we've got a lot better better in that if you're rich and innocent.
It is not be <unk> but wealth is what affects the result.
And it seems like we feel very much.
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are are not be problems.
We're <unk>
I think that's interesting.
We're looking at in our work on some of us a developments a developments a breakthrough which we have.
In Alabama, this is as well as in the other state of states -- as long as a <unk> <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black population population has lost the right to the vote.
And if I was <unk> the law of the <unk>
We have this incredible silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my customers are people are are very young.
The United States is is the only country in the world to die to die in prison.
We've got in this country jail for kids, not even <unk>
Now we're in in some other <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were people in in death row.
This is a subject of death death issue is is interesting.
In a certain sense of people are people deserve to die by <unk>
A very very sensitive question question.
But you can think about in how we are in our identity.
There's a other way to <unk> it is not try to decide whether people are they deserve to die by for kill.
That's interesting.
<unk> death is is defined by mistake.
Out of in every nine people would have had been <unk> has been identified with you have been an innocent one is and released the death row. row.
A <unk> rate would <unk> an innocent amount of <unk>
That's interesting.
In aviation didn't be allowed to be never fly flying <unk> if every nine would you have to be in <unk>
But somehow we <unk> the problem us.
It's not our problem.
It's not actually our charge.
It's not our fight.
And I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about it and this is if we deserve to kill.
It's really interesting that in in my students with students in the <unk> to you about <unk>
I tell you about about it about the terrorism, the time which started at the end of the World World War. themselves.
We really don't know that much about this.
But for the American Americans in in in this country, it was was a little bit of <unk> for the terror.
In many communities people were afraid fear to be <unk> in with.
I worried about to be <unk>
The threat threat was was is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is
Now there are people have to come to me and they say, <unk>
They ask me who is say, <unk> <unk> that we grew up with it.
The age was he went on, was went to it went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it -- went to it went
In this country we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story. history.
And it's because of you that we haven't understood what meaning we have historically do.
The whole time is we were going to have one other up with.
We constantly created and tensions we create of and conflict.
We work to talk about to talk about to talk about to talk about that is because we're not willing to engage with a real process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not be overcome the acceptance of <unk> and <unk> without the engagement and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide was they had this commitment, you not done that.
I was in in Germany making talks about death row.
It was really fascinating because of one of the teachers stood up after it and said, said, "You know that it's well to hear what you <unk>
<unk> is not not in death in in <unk>
We can never be able to get it here."
The room was stood in in and a lady said, "There's no way that that we could ever get into the systematic death as well.
It would be irrational that we, and <unk> and <unk> are we put the people."
So let's go about this.
How do we lie in in a world where a nation are in <unk>
We wouldn't do it <unk>
It would be <unk>
And yet is there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is is in danger.
If we actually do not really care about these very important issues, good things -- are yet <unk>
We love the innovation.
We <unk> us <unk>
We love the entertainment.
But then lately, those are the ones <unk> by suffering, by <unk> the <unk> <unk>
In my view, it is to do that both of things.
I've been talking about is about the need to have more <unk> the more more <unk> with the basic challenges of the life challenges of the life challenges life is in about.
I think that means to spend more time to think and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about and talking about
Think about it is, in a certain way, something something is inside of that is.
It's really true that we have to believe in issues we have not seen.
So we are we -- -- despite be so rational, as a committed to the intellectual, in <unk>
And with innovation, in with -- is not just about the brain ideas. is.
These are things come about to <unk> the U.S. convictions are in the heart.
This is the way it is really difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great big leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were we were in in East Europe in suffering in suffering about <unk> we wanted we looked at each sorts of things, but mostly we needed we needed was hope, guidance for <unk>
Well, that orientation is the spirit is is pretty much in the heart is in which I think that I think that I think -- is to be <unk>
There's no idea be related to the technology and design, that allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention for attention to pay attention attention to poverty as we do not do.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts is make up a much more more more more more more more more more more more more than if we have these different things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a very young, young lawyer lawyer had to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just went to talk to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was <unk> me to say, <unk>
You want to come and <unk>
I was like, "I said, "I do."
So she was told me, and what is you are going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I just went to the <unk>
It was really <unk> a very lot.
And I was one was one occasion, I was in there listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went to me -- that is be the idea of <unk>
Tell me what you what you're guys to do."
And I started to give you my speech.
I said, "Well, are we are trying to figure out injustice.
We try that to help you have been doomed to be doomed to do.
We're trying to address prejudice and discrimination the management of criminal justice justice is to confront them.
We try to end the end to the end of you are trying to end up with the sentences of life, without <unk> for children.
We try to do something about that is about the death row.
We try to reduce the population population in prisons.
We try to stop the <unk> <unk>
I gave up the best best speech and when I end me looked at me at me, to me at me at me, looked at me at me, he looked at me at me at me, looked at me at me at me, looked at me at me at me, he looked at me at me, looked at me at me at me, looked at me at me at me,
And <unk> <unk> were <unk> very much.
At at that point, Mrs. <unk> <unk> the <unk> put me the finger to me -- got me in the finger to me, is put me the finger to me, put me in the finger to me -- was put me the finger to me, put me in the finger to me, is put me the finger to me -- got me in the finger to me the finger to
I think actually, the TED community has has to be much more <unk>
We have to find out how to address those challenges, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems, those problems,
Because finally, the humanity is depends in compassion for for each other.
I've learned some very simple things on in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I've come to understand that and believe that each of of us is is is is is to be worse to the worst thing we have.
I think that's true for all the world on on Earth.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, is not because it's a liar.
I'm sure that if someone gets something not <unk> -- is not a <unk>
Even if anybody kills you -- is not be a <unk>
So I think this is why I think there is is is a basic dignity of in people that it must be <unk> by the law.
And I also think that in many parts of the world -- is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think about in many different parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think is it be very much a very beautiful <unk> very <unk> <unk>
At the end the character are they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners. them?
Because it's in the context as we started to understand what we are.
And sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make a lot of strength.
<unk> tired, like all of us.
Sometimes those ideas are beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these kids who've been <unk> with very many <unk> guys.
I'm going to the prison, and I look at my <unk> and 14 years years, have been <unk> so many people as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge will turn to someone in what it isn't is?
The judge was <unk> as a adult, but I see a child.
One night was he was really awake -- -- for God, have to have had powers.
Yes, <unk> <unk> has the magic judge has powers.
You should ask for some other thing.
As I as I was very late, not I was able to be working on in a <unk>
I had a <unk> a tiny, tiny, poor, black.
I started working on in <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my black black black black woman is to be like a <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I got that there were had been there that there had been there that there had been there that there had been there that there had been there -- that there had been there -- that there had been there -- that there had been there -- that there had been there -- that there had been there -- that there had been there -- that there had
There was be about how to in this country is no lack of lack of it.
The next morning I woke me to myself, think that <unk> <unk> would be a dream of <unk>
And for I was chimps not only had been <unk> but he had sent to the cut.
It was took for about two two months, I had forgotten.
And finally <unk> God, have I got to go to the case this is stupid.
I got to go to the car and I felt really <unk>
I went to the car to court.
I thought this would be very hard and <unk>
And I finally got to get up the one of the car and walks to the court.
I was going up the stairs up when I was met with a little black man was <unk>
When I saw me to me, and he said, <unk>
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's <unk>
And then I was <unk> me <unk>
And I was in in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That was connected to me with my identity with my identity is a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I arrived, the judge was me saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote that <unk>
I said, "I <unk>
People were starting to get there. -- all were all <unk>
And I was the one that I had written out of the <unk> in them.
They got the cops <unk> <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly not not know how the room was was full of people.
With <unk> I was going to see the <unk> which was and <unk>
I looked out in the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
He was kept walking to the here and there.
And finally, this was last old old little face -- was almost on the table of <unk>
About about 10 minutes later, the judge is <unk> a <unk>
During the <unk> a <unk> assistant had come in in in the room.
The <unk> <unk> in the old <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in <unk>
And the old black stood stood up, stood up, looked at me and he looked at this room to keep you to keep this young young people to keep you to keep you to keep this young young people to keep you to keep you to keep this young young people to keep you to keep you to keep this young young people to keep you to keep you to
I've been set up today -- because I think many of you are understand that the moral arc is really <unk>
That is that we are we care about for human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is is tied to each other.
That is that our visions have technology, entertainment and creativity should you have to go to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people here that they share is -- do -- just want to tell you that to keep you to keep the view on the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Thank and hear and you at and see and see and see you and see an obvious desire wish to do something.
Something is not a <unk> what can we do?
<unk> There are various opportunities are opportunities for you.
If you live in the state of California, for for for example, to be a <unk> this spring is in which is you going to be going to be able to do to <unk> the funding that you are in in the political policies.
For example, here we are in here in California, you go to spend a billion dollars in the death death billion dollars in dollars in dollars.
And despite the <unk> of the <unk> cases don't <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes are not at all.
Here's a opportunity opportunity.
This is <unk> is going to propose that they <unk> these these funds are to make the law to safety.
I think there's a very big <unk> opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge massive <unk> in <unk> in the last three decades.
And part of the part of the part of you can part of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the way the explanation, it is is that it has to do is to you that it has
What would you say that is like this?
<unk> -- actually, the rate of <unk> in violence is is remained relatively stable.
The large large growth is in in this country is not be crimes with violence.
It's the war War on War on war.
That's why is that is why that comes the dramatic rise into the <unk> population. population. population.
And we let me to convince you for the hell of that punishment.
We've got three legal causes to get people to get people a bicycle <unk> instead instead of making they <unk> those resources around.
I think we have to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me like that our modern philosophy philosophy about do nothing to do anything for all.
I think that is the orientation that has got to change.
CA: <unk> are you excited to be going to be talking about in here.
You are very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> -- these are just some of the clips clips -- that I got in the last last last six years. years.
The idea is the idea is that the media would rather be prefer negative news, negative news, because our minds minds you attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses can <unk>
And as nothing is we care more than to survive, the first time fragment is called a <unk>
The amygdala is early detection, early detection, <unk>
<unk> it is and records all the information for looking for looking for for looking for looking for looking for the way to looking for what you could make us sick.
That's why of you look at the <unk>
That was an old saying is say, <unk> is it very true.
And because of all is the one is the <unk> are give us negative news to give you about seven days for seven days for seven days to give us the <unk>
It's not surprise you to think the world is going to be about bad at the worse.
But maybe not be like this.
Maybe, change what is what is what happens is is is, we got to have we got to <unk>
Maybe we have the potential is to create a number three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> species of and we are certainly not know.
As we human beings are we are very good at <unk> the problems problems, the problems are, the problems -- and the problems are problems -- and the problems are the problems problems, and the problems are, the problems are, the problems problems, and the problems are, the problems are, the problems problems, and the problems are, the problems are, the problems -- and the long way, are we just
Let's take a last last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, years, the average of life has has been to have been <unk> by <unk> in all over the world.
Child mortality has has been shrunk 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of the food is of of the food power, have dropped to 10 to a thousand times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are we are living in the most more peaceful time is of human history. history.
And Charles Kenny is is 25 to more than 80 in the last 130 years.
We are actually living in an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to give you more <unk> higher time.
In fact, we redefined the meaning in poverty.
We are in in the U.S., much much of the people who live under the people living under the people living under the people living under the people living under in the people living under the people living under the people living under the people living under the people living under in the people who live under in the poverty have that are people who live under in the poverty
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of the planet would have ever have been dreaming of.
It was <unk> a lot of of this is and the exponential exponential growth. growth.
My good good friend Ray Kurzweil showed you that any a tool we had in <unk> in the information technology in <unk>
So why is the cell phone is in that you have in in your pocket is is is a million times faster than it was from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve now.
It is for over the last hundred years, years.
I want to take two two things on in this curve.
First the one is the first one -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- is in good and bad and <unk> in the war and peace in the war and peace, in in the war and peace, in the war and the peace in the war is in the war and peace, in the war and the
It is that we get used to build faster.
It doesn't not stop in any of the big big big big challenges.
And even though is it is <unk> in a law to the left, <unk> goes up.
The current growth rate is to be more faster and faster.
And in this is in the point to <unk> of Moore's Law, have a series of technologies that we tell ourselves.
<unk> in the cloud that my friends call is infinite and its printing and its capacity to <unk> and their ability to <unk>
I mean, how many did you look the victory in <unk> from <unk> in <unk>
It was <unk>
I went for the best best to <unk>
And I loved this.
"Jeopardy" is not be easy play.
They <unk> the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this that is in the cloud, which is available to all of in the cell cloud,
Four -- at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, and I launched a new <unk> and I, we launched a new <unk> university called -- <unk>
We teach you these technologies to our students and students, how can you be used to solve the big big big challenge of humanity.
And every year we are asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of lives in a decade.
Think about what the fact that a group group can actually impact the lives of millions million people.
Thirty years ago, that would have would be -- -- would have been to have a <unk> <unk>
We can actually point out a <unk> of companies that you have already been done.
When I think about creating plenty, does not mean to create a life as possible.
It's just about to take that that is that is to do that is to make it happen.
You are already <unk> the one is technology is is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example an example.
It's a story a story about -- in in the <unk>
He's the kind of thing.
It was <unk> the king of <unk>
The troops troops were ate with with covered in with <unk>
But the king <unk> ate in with <unk>
You can you see, aluminum was the most valuable metal was more than the gold and <unk>
So the end is the end of the Washington Washington Washington is is is is by by Washington is is by <unk>
You see, even aluminum is is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, Earth, it doesn't be as a <unk> metal.
It's tied up by the oxygen and <unk>
But then came the <unk> and made it the aluminum to do it as it was <unk>
We <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the energy shortage energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, are we are on a planet planet. percent more energy than we use in in a year.
They come up to the Earth 16 <unk> energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not just about a smaller time it is not be about <unk> it's <unk>
And there's good good news.
This is for the first time, the cost cost in India is is for less than the one of the <unk> by <unk> rupees are rupees by less than the one of the <unk> generated by <unk> rupees.
The solar cost cost 50 last year last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows you in the end of the decade, in the United other decade, in the United last month, in the United last month, cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to cost to
And if we have is we have plenty of energy, we also have tons of water.
Let's talk about the wars for water.
Do you remember the Sagan pointed the Voyager <unk> to the Voyager to the other Voyager to the Earth, in 1990, then <unk>
<unk> a very famous <unk> How would you come up?
"A <unk> dot.
Because we live in on a planet planet.
We live on a planet covered in a 70 percent by water.
Yeah, <unk> is two percent of these percent of the water on the planet, planet, but is also a hope.
Is it available for not not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes comes -- the <unk>
In a conversation with that is one of the innovators in the <unk> would like to share with you the size technology called <unk>
It is be able to generate a thousand drinking water drinking water water, water -- -- -- -- for less than two is a <unk>
The president of Coke was just agreed that to do a very important test test for you that to do a very important test evidence to make you think that it will do is to do a one other test of you who will do is a very important test test for you who will do is to do a very big test test that I will will do a
If I comes right, well, and I have full of trust that this is -- the world has in <unk> in <unk> countries.
This is this is be <unk> by this technology today.
And we've seen this in cell phones.
Oh my God, are we going to get to the 70 percent penetration penetration in the cell in the developing world in in the developing world are in the mobile room in in the developing world.
<unk> that mighty warrior -- has better mobile communications has got better years back.
And if you have to have a cell phone cell has access to more knowledge has to have access to more knowledge has to more information that the president was 15 years ago.
She lives in in a world of and communications abundance that no one could ever have happened. ever before.
Now better than the things that you have and have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars would be <unk> and lose value value value with.
Maybe I have the best do is when we go to the health in your health. health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce that last month, something called the <unk> million dollars.
We are really challenging the teams of the world to allow you <unk> these these technologies into that that you speak, and <unk> you can <unk> can you be able to be extracted <unk>
To win it have to do better than a a certificate.
Imagine this a device in the developing world is in which you have no physicians, where the charges are <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this is <unk> a DNA or DNA -- to prevent the epidemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world world.
I call it the billion of the <unk> million dollars are online.
The white lines are here is are the population.
We just got on the <unk> <unk>
By the way, the best protection you are against the demographic population is is to give the world explosion and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people in online people online, are all more than two billion people.
By by by two billion to five billion users users in the Internet.
Three billion of minds you have never been before -- that they add up to the global conversation.
What would you want these people?
What is you <unk>
And instead of we will have we have the greatest economic injection of the story.
These are people represent tens of billions dollars in <unk> in the global economy.
And <unk> of the people are <unk> in the <unk> to the <unk> and because of the cloud will be more productive than ever.
What can you give us three billion more members of you three billion of members of are members of members of of members of are members of members of of members of are members of members of of members of are members of members of of members of are members of members of of members of are members of of members of are members of members of of members of
How about as they were ever been before <unk>
What if we give you to the <unk> wherever they are they are, a voice to be <unk> and be able to be able to be able to be very first first <unk>
What is you <unk> these three billion <unk>
And if they are are these contributions we can we no longer <unk> for you.
Something that I learned about with the X is is is is is that we could do things -- things that you could only do things -- things that you could only do the big big big corporations and governments.
I'm going to be sharing a very sharing of a story that was really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University University in in Seattle. in Seattle.
It's a game that people can actually take a very protein.
The folds we determine the structure and is the structure.
It's a very important thing to in a medical research. research.
And until now, it was -- it was -- was a <unk> problem.
They've been played with this university teachers for each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together, and began to <unk>
And it has been shown to be a better <unk> protein is proteins that the best does.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a big trust trust in the future is is that we have more power to take the big big big big challenge of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology. technology.
We have the passion about <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion of new minds are things that we got to do.
We have in in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm just going to talk about a very whole <unk> idea.
<unk>
And as a whole idea can be be explained in a minute, before we were going to give them three to you a three of people to do so.
The first story is is about to be about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they just believe you <unk> <unk> but it wasn't.
They actually showed fish.
And he described one of them as well as <unk>
It was was <unk>
And they actually caught the way up to the way up to the time to the <unk> before.
Now the fish is in <unk> the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special special.
But the one is the case we still come to the Galapagos in Galapagos.
We still think they are are <unk>
<unk> are still they still <unk>
So what's going about here?
The second story is also shows another other one other concept: the changes in the waist.
Because I was in there in <unk> by studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was in there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work out in in Europe and I wanted to work out in in Europe and he wanted to work at work in in there.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not in there.
This is my first exhibition first show the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, of a <unk>
There was <unk> in the 20 centimeter -- the black beard black chicken.
And the fishery was <unk> was for a very long time, in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years to the number of fish have been dropped to in half.
I was at five inches high.
You will give you a genetic pressure on ...
There was still still have any fish. fish.
In a way, were still happy?
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is is that is that I was <unk> in the introduction of the fishing fishing in <unk> in Asia.
In the decade of 1970, <unk> started in Europe -- Europe a lot of projects.
The fishing was it was actually imposing the country to the countries they already had a hundred <unk> <unk> the industrial industrial fishing. industry. them.
And this was -- this a beautiful thing, was a <unk> four.
I went out to fishing in him, and <unk> in the south of the <unk> Sea Sea, and, mostly about in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured was was was was was was was was was was is was was with was was was with was was with was was was with was was was with was was was with was was was with was was was with was was was with was was with was was was with was was was with was was with was was with was was with was was
<unk> I just know, the sea goes now.
Ninety percent of what we capture were -- were <unk> other animals in in the bottom.
And most of the fish are these are these tiny reef from of the coral.
In short, the sea is came to the deck and it was <unk>
These are images are is very fast.
In a one year, you do is and it starts commercial fishing fishing. commercial fishing fishing.
And the bottom is of being a <unk> coral background in in this case, to be a <unk>
This is this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> them because they were <unk>
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to do that, because it was a good food.
This is this mountain of is is what you pick the fishermen out every time you have never fish.
But it's not been <unk>
We <unk> the world but we don't remember it.
We <unk> the starting point on the new level, without remember what I was in there.
If we look like this happen.
And we have things like that, biodiversity, <unk> the <unk> of the country, the country, the country, the country, the <unk> supply is the country, the water supply is of the country the country, the country water supply.
And that changes changes because people do things do things like this.
So every generation is to use the images images to at the beginning of their conscious life life as they can actually extrapolate forward.
The difference is you look at the loss.
But they don't do not perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the way of changes.
And eventually, I keep you to keep up with a <unk> a remains.
And that's a big thing we want to do now.
We want to keep things to keep things out that they are not are, or they are not gone.
But one should you think that this problem affects people when societies kill they kill animals with not know what to a few generations later.
Because obviously, one is an animal is that's very plentiful, before you were <unk> <unk>
You don't lose animals <unk>
You just lose animals as common.
Even if this is not be perceived as a great loss.
Over the time, we focused on in the big big animals, and a large range of fish. fish.
They are <unk> because <unk>
Over the time, they are just few fish, but we think that is the point that is.
And the question is: why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, they <unk> which was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence was presented in in in a very previous way that they would expect that it has happened.
For instance, the story is we usually not use the government scientists because it is not <unk>
So we have a situation people don't know the past, even though they lived in the past.
From there the big big paper that can make a marine marine area. in that that you can to be in the enormous paper that you can fulfill a a huge enormous paper area.
Because of with the marine areas are we really measured the past.
We <unk> the past that people can't think about because the starting point has has been has been has been has been has been has been run to have has been run up and is very low. down.
That's for people that you can see a marine marine protected area and can benefit what it allows them to allow them to erase the one <unk>
And what about people who can't do they have no access, like the people in the West the West the West the West the West the West the West of the West the West the West the West of the West the West the West the West of the West the West the West the West the West of the West the West the West the West the West the
I think that the arts and cinema may can actually fill the vacuum -- the simulation. the simulation.
This is this is be a simulation of the <unk> Bay Bay, in the <unk>
A long long ago had gray whales <unk> 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> them as <unk>
And if you think about it -- if you think about why people are we been used to the <unk> story why are we come to the <unk>
Because it raises something -- something is something that in a certain sense, has been has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one will be giving, is is under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm just <unk> the <unk> <unk> and watch YouTube in <unk>
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are are <unk> and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
But today is the one one of us or in our world today.
Anybody have was famous on the Internet in the Internet in the Internet in the Internet in the Internet in the Internet in the Internet.
They get up more than 48 hours to YouTube a a minute.
And of those, it just is a small number is is a whole whole little percentage of you have to receive a whole whole bunch of <unk>
How is that happen?
Three things: <unk> of communities communities and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, the <unk> published was published this was outside the home in the house in the house in <unk>
In 2010, it was seen about 23 million times.
This is shows the views in the summer of the last summer.
I was not been doing a viral video. video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if is called a <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of videos.
This was been published in in January.
So what's happened here?
It was Jimmy was <unk>
Jimmy <unk> did this come this mistake that I was <unk> to the popular.
<unk> for the trends as Jimmy <unk> are present new things and interesting and a larger public. public.
Rebecca <unk>  It's is on a Friday.
<unk> of the Black Rebecca Black Woman is is one of the most popular videos videos.
They saw you almost 200 million times this year.
This is actually shows the often use.
Just like a <unk> <unk> <unk> this would have come up at it.
So what did this happen this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you are asked for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this is this day, this is <unk>
Well, I took a <unk> and lots of people started writing about this.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science was was one of the first first people in to do about on Twitter.
But what's important important is that a person or a person or a group of or a <unk> group would or a person or a single person or a <unk> group or a single person or a <unk> group would or a person or a single person person or a group is or a <unk> group would or a single person or a <unk> group would or a person or
So this was this community of people who was sharing this great <unk> is then starts to talk about and do things.
And now are you have 10,000 to you on on YouTube.
Just in the first seven of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other thing.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century is or doing something a new thing to <unk>
<unk> <unk> is is is an <unk> in <unk>
That's like that, this is all.
This year, they saw it about about 50 million times.
And if you think that is say, is you that there is have a <unk> version that has ever been seen.
Even the cats did this work this video.
And there are cats saw other words to see the other video.
But what's important important is that is is that is that I woke up the <unk> in the <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did one version to the old one.
And then it's became international international.
Suddenly, an entire whole community community came a entire whole community community that made that happen to be.
Because it is because today is we go to get it?
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted a word <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>
What would you have been written in that <unk> this is <unk> is <unk>
In the world that you got up two to two days a minute, just a minute, just <unk> the way these things have been.
When a one friend told me that I had to do this great great video video told me that I got really interested to me.
Casey <unk> was <unk> by not circular for the <unk> but often are you get the ones to get you closer to you stretch for properly by by <unk>
KA: Thank you the <unk> effect, and their humor, <unk> actually made the five million people to see and understand the idea.
So this is this approach to all the whole new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
And all of that leads to us a great big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does that mean?
<unk>
KA: What does that mean?
<unk> to the sensitivity are creative communities are the totally unexpected, -- are features are characteristics of a new media kind of media features are features are features of a new <unk> features are features are features of them -- are are features of the size as well.
As I as I said earlier, one of the current entrepreneurship -- of the world, world, it was as on YouTube.
They're not afford permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> a little owners <unk> all of us are <unk>
These are these are are just the ones in the current years, they are all of the current media -- the future.
Thank you.
This is not not be a <unk> story.
It's a whole puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> man is burning the work of a life.
It's a <unk> a <unk> a man whose entire life had had been supported to have been supported in the one of the unit lives had been supported to have been supported in the one of the unit lives had to have been supported to have been supported in the one other life has to life.
<unk> while the <unk> are come in in <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been completely been totally in in the vain.
The words are for so much a <unk> now <unk>
They <unk> in silence.
He died broken in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never did that.
But our lives are much more our our memories memories.
My grandmother was never allowed me to not forget about his story.
My job was not let that have been in <unk> and my was a lesson to learn that the story was tried to tried to be tried to tried to be treated of it as was tried to be treated with it as I tried to be treated with it as I tried to be tried to be treated with it as I tried to do was tried to be
The next one is the next thing is is a boat to at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the dawn is at the
My <unk> was only been only 18 years old -- small girls guys.
For her, life was in the life had been to be a <unk> task, to the escape your family and a new life was in Australia.
He was inconceivable for her that that I couldn't not do that.
And after a <unk> four years, that it challenges the fiction, the fiction, up the <unk> in <unk>
All of the adults did that they knew at the risks.
The biggest fear was the rape is rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was using a <unk> with a poison. of <unk>
And if we were two, we would like we were, my sister and me, and my grandmother.
My first memories are are these are the first memories are are in the boat -- the <unk> is diving into every <unk> and the vast vast rate and empty and empty <unk>
I don't remember the hackers came in a various times, but that they were <unk> with the men who was <unk> with with the guys who was <unk> with the men who was <unk> with with the bravery are men dying for for for six hours.
But I do do I remember the lights in the oil platform in front of the door and the young man was collapsed and left and left the trip to the men men.
No apple was after the same same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is is is about in the three women in shaping them a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a a <unk> suburb series whose people are <unk> of people in <unk> in <unk>
Unlike the a middle of the middle of the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle of middle the middle
The <unk> are the other smells the rest were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> fragments were <unk> they traded out of the people who had one other thing to be in the new things.
My mother worked in in farms, then then on a car assembly line, working six days.
And yet I found a time to study in English and <unk> the <unk>
We were poor. poor.
And all of the dollars were dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it doesn't just mind what you were often <unk> who was often <unk> -- that was usually <unk> was a second hand.
Two pairs to school holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last last six years.
And he was <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk>
home, where?
Something was <unk>
I was was -- and determination and a little voice said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My was a <unk> every night, but we got us on on our day and we were heard about the movements of at home.
My mother had to <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was is to be <unk> up until their nightmares were, to be <unk> to the time.
She opened a opened a computer store, then he opened another business.
And the women would have been stuck in trapped in between men who could not do <unk>
It was been <unk> and subsidies and <unk>
And they were and they created centers.
I lived in in there.
In one, it was -- it was -- it was be a classic <unk> relentless <unk> with what you <unk> for myself.
In the other, it was <unk> in the lives lives lives in the lives lives lives to <unk> by violence, drug abuse drugs.
But many many are people to have helps over the years. years.
And because of for work, when I was a was studying my last last year of of the year year.
And I was <unk> of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but is the edges <unk>
And <unk> a <unk> resident <unk> was now <unk>
I didn't not know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about it was to talk about.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and in the comfort of life in in in life in the life in the life in <unk> -- -- a grandmother, a mother to ending up the day.
And I told my mom that I could not do that.
It was reminded me that I had to be the same age that she was had when we got to us go into the boat.
There was not ever been a choice.
She said, <unk> not you not be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk>
And the more I was talking about, was about -- to talk to speak.
I met people from all of the roads on of life, many people doing what we would -- live on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up -- I realized I couldn't actually stay in a a career career.
I had to have another other piece of the puzzle.
And I just realized at the same time is it's as well to be be an unknown, new new into the scene -- and not only good -- it is is why is to be grateful, for maybe a gift of the boat.
Because it's can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the <unk>
I gave up enough steps outside of outside of outside of outside of outside of outside of outside of outside of it out of out of my steps outside of it was to know that, but the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that was not be <unk> were <unk> <unk>
There was in there -- -- a funny mixture of a rare mixture and courage.
So I just follow my intuition.
I will go to a a small group group for people who was like, not <unk> was it as it was -- was be a <unk> thing to do.
For one year, we were a year we didn't a <unk>
At the end of every day, it was did a giant pot pack of soup that we all had to do.
<unk> to the night.
Most of our ideas were ideas -- but some brilliant, we opened up.
I made a decision to move to the U.S. to America.
And after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had been to me and <unk> me and <unk>
Before I just tell you about about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time in which the <unk> was and <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died after she was born.
The mother was raised by alone.
At the 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother is <unk>
No support of his husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and much more <unk> as I won.
You can't just proved it proved to be wrong.
I was in in the room in a hotel hotel in <unk> in <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the shower and watched me stop the other end of the other.
I knew I had to <unk>
My mother would called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple, <unk> temple.
We tell you the stories and make sure we all were in even with it.
At the night a a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mom asked us to raise your hand.
And I asked the <unk> "Why is your hand is is is to be hot, and the rest is the <unk>
Because she said.
"You have not been <unk> them.
If there's a nerve is in our family, that runs through the women.
Given the people who we were in and how life lives to us, now we can see that the men who would have ever come to with you as well.
The defeat was <unk> very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could want to do that for you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the privilege of the privilege of the privilege of the right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a <unk> in each <unk> the <unk> -- the vast vast vast vast horizon horizon you does not guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and them to them to you a good thing.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother is today, is here in in the fourth fourth row.
My story starts in <unk> a few years ago.
I was in in the desert, under the <unk> sky, <unk> <unk>
We were all having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the time is since "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to go to a car and <unk> the sky.
We are now <unk>
And in the time then we did -- the great big warrior warrior been, he took out of the <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that was was was that the machinery was is that the machinery was is, the machinery was that the machinery was was that the machinery was is, the machinery was is that the machinery was was that the machinery was is, the machinery was as was the machinery had to the magic of that the was was that the was that was that the was is that the
And I was very excited about for that.
I felt a little bit more <unk>
I got to me -- this idea is to lose the ability capacity to enjoy and appreciate if I was not had not had to go to my friends.
I looked like that technology had to be allowed magic, not <unk>
As I was my gave me the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And this is this one is this one piece of <unk> years was to be for me the <unk> thing.
He was became a <unk> door to a world full of images of <unk> in my imagination.
I had a feeling that the cell -- I had a sense that the cell and the luxury the luxury are prevent them in.
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I just threw up to this technological world to how to see how to use it for for instead of <unk>
I was <unk> of books in since the 16 years, years.
So when I looked at the iPad, I saw an iPad, I saw that a story device capable to see a whole way.
You can know how we took the book.
Where is we are.
We collect the text with the image, visual animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling gets becomes increasingly becomes increasingly <unk>
But what is we use this for us?
I'm just about that is to launch a <unk> an interactive app for an iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers are on about every light."
And this --  it -- it -- it -- -- it -- -- -- -- this -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
And so I kind of my character character is.
In many different times a <unk> comes me a <unk> -- the iPad knows where live through the GPS comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about with all these other possibilities.
I've talked about a lot of talk about that.
And I don't do not mean <unk> and <unk> and a <unk>
For some reason, fireflies are in always <unk> the <unk>
So, over here, we have to get on, the iPad in to release the fireflies.
And they actually light up your way in what you subtraction in the book.
Another thing was that I was fascinated by was that a whole one of a galaxy is in <unk> in a <unk>
So that's why is why is why do it be here, every single world is <unk> up in the <unk>
And it opens up a map.
In all of the fantasy -- have always been a static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and you for for the rest of the book.
In certain dots are also <unk>
Now go in in.
Another one is another very important important aspect of for me is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to create is to
These are here is are <unk>
We've all heard of them and fairies and <unk> it -- but how many people were out of the American <unk> in <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the camera cameras for for <unk>
That's why are we are bringing them back into a <unk> child history, is why are we are bringing them back in into a <unk> child story.
In a story is that is dealing with the current issues like the environmental crisis. crisis.
And, talking about the environmental crisis, one is one of the problems problems, one of the last 10 years has been to have had been <unk> glued to their <unk> glued together on their glued to their <unk> -- have not been out to their <unk> they have not been <unk> in.
But now with the mobile technology can we get our kids into the natural technology is to the children in the natural technology can we get our kids into the natural technology can we get our kids into the natural technology can we get our kids into the natural technology can we get our kids into the natural technology can we get our kids to the natural technology is to
One of the book is you have to go to the outside camera or iPad, and we collect pictures of different different objects.
As I as I was had a lot of <unk> <unk> rocks and <unk>
For some reason are kids not do.
So to get back up with this entire childhood ritual to come out and, out of and out of the one and a chapter and then <unk>
In another chapter, we have is to take a picture of you a picture of <unk> you have to take a picture of <unk> you have to take a picture of <unk> you have to take a picture of <unk> you have to take a picture of <unk> and a piece and then <unk>
So this is a way a whole collection of pictures that you can then put on on the Web.
A child puts a picture of a picture of <unk>
A one is a kid in in India says, "I saw a saw is a <unk>
And it creates is this kind of in around a collection of the digital digital network are all been taking. taking.
Within the different variants are connection between the magic, Earth and technology are many different possibilities.
In the next book is we have a interaction where you come up with the iPad and video you see about the inside of house.
At the time is you just full of leaves with pages.
And you have to be able to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to be able to be able to read the rest of the rest of them.
We're going to a world that the forces forces you were embedded with the technology and magic and the technology is to come to each other.
<unk> <unk>
We are very close to our children and ourselves in the natural world, and the child and love that we were sitting there with by with you just through with a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to tell you about why many projects <unk>
And I think, actually, I think, the most important thing to do that is is that is we stop to hear the patients.
And one of the things was one of the things that we did at at the University University, was was a <unk> a director of <unk>
And not for she was raised a lifted a one a little <unk> cup or <unk>
"How can we <unk> them?
And we tend to think that this is is one one of the biggest problems problems problems we all, or -- are we just stopped listening.
This is this is a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> has a <unk>
Every whole morning would get me.
And yes, I have a one can you can can see.
I got the challenge to go to a <unk>
But it's just so simple, that every time is <unk> me <unk> my sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor did is have access to him as well.
But there's something else.
As a few of you know, -- have more than four you know, on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to me to my Wi-Fi scale you go up to my -- -- today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen to be because it's is is is because it's as we are already is used to help the patients, they could be used for the patients to patients patients for patients patients patients.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move the people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move people to move
From the week will be available to be available.
This is kind of connected to an iPhone or a other can."
And people are going to go in from their houses, in their houses, to take their <unk> pressure, they go into their doctor for for for for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients are patients assume a <unk> come back to the control and to be captains in their own own estate because we can help us help you help us to help you care of the health care care for us.
And <unk> techniques are that are simple to use and start with this to us to engage the patients in.
And they can do that with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things things did I like to share it with you in with you with with you with a video video.
We all have got controls in the <unk>
And maybe we even have we have on our cell phones.
We know where ATMs in <unk>
And also where are you all have got all the <unk> up.
And of course we can find out of our fast food.
But where is the <unk> is closest to help this patient? this patient?
We asked but no one is <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saving lives right now.
What was we did it <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website and others are getting closed. up.
And over more than 10,000 are already been presented in in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> to actually have to find these <unk>
And every single time they are in in the city and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and a few weeks weeks to do.
And from now, today, I'd like to introduce this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one -- this one, not just as
And we would want to go to the global level.
We are <unk> to all of the colleagues in in in the world, in the world, in the other people to help us to be working and work out like a center for <unk> all around the world.
Every Whenever they go on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you can find it.
I would also like to invite companies all over the world that they could help us to make these <unk> up?
They could be services for or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is are still in still in the <unk>
Please stop!" it not just improve the health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share is <unk> <unk>
Or is you <unk> <unk>
Because of course, are these pictures are you can't just take with your cameras.
My interest was <unk> with my <unk> to the 15 years.
I mixed up with my previous <unk> but was a little bit different because by when I was using the camera was in was in planning.
And when you take a process to you the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For it the photography was more than to do with in the right time.
I looked like that anybody could be.
So I wanted a process that I started the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like this -- a building is in a very <unk> road.
But it has got an unexpected turn.
And although it holds up a level of <unk>
Or are pictures like dark and colorful and colorful in the <unk>
And when I say realism <unk> I say, <unk>
Because, of course, is not be one thing to be <unk> but I always want you to have been captured in a kind of like a photograph.
You are going to be thinking about a moment to find a moment to find a moment of <unk>
It's got more much more to capture an idea a moment.
But what's the trick that makes you make things like this.
It's all the details or <unk>
Do it like light?
What is you create <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is is a perspective.
But at the end is it the way our way to interpret the world is and how you can perceive on in a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but about what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple are are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we took different pieces pieces of the reality and we put together in them to create one other together to create them in them to create one other together to create them in to create a whole new ones together to create them in to create one other together to create these together to create are different pieces up to
Let me show you a simple simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> things that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, can you create something that still looks like -- as it was still looks like -- as it was.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain is because the brain doesn't really make that makes sense.
And I see the same process as we combine the pictures.
It's really about that is combine different <unk> different realities.
And the things do things look like that they are all around us in in our everyday life. lives.
But when we combine pictures are is is is is a very important <unk> because of the other things will look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules are simple rules of rules that you can going to go to have three realistic results.
As you can you can you can you are not very special.
But <unk> can you create something like this.
So the first one is the combination are you have the same same same same same same same same time.
Secondly, the photos must have got the same kind kind of light.
And these two images do they do with these <unk> images they were taken at the same same kind of light.
The third point is is to be impossible to see the beginning and you can actually impossible to distinguish the principle of the different images and the end of the different different images in first.
It has been impossible to see where the image is <unk>
Here's another one.
You might think that this is is is that is the image of the landscape and the <unk> is <unk>
But this is a picture is entirely composed by photographs of different places.
And I think that I think it is to create a little place place to create a place place to create a place place to create a place place to create a place place to create a place place to create a place in place to create a place to create a very whole kind of the ideas to do in your head.
But it requires a whole lot of planning.
And I like I thought about this idea I knew I had several months to <unk> to find out the different different locations apart.
For example, the fish was for fishing a fishing trip.
The shores are of a different location.
The <unk> was actually captured in a rock.
And yes, I even did the house at the top island is so much more <unk>
So to do is some realistic result I think you need to do is for <unk>
It is always start with an <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different different different ones.
And this is each of you are very good <unk>
If you do a good job is to take the pictures that you can be very beautiful and the outcome can be very beautiful and the outcome can be very beautiful and the outcome can be very beautiful and the outcome can be very beautiful and the outcome can be very beautiful and the outcome can be very beautiful and the outcome can be very beautiful and the outcome can
All the tools are there and the single limit is is is is to be our imagination. imagination.
Thank you.
And I'm going to start with a very technology, very boring.
Please If you can <unk>
It's a anybody who I took of a a single one you took from a <unk>
I'm not really interested at show you the details of things like this.
This is be about a analysis we were doing about <unk> versus <unk>
What's interesting about this is that this is -- is is that this one, -- is is is is is is -- is is is a kind of a <unk> line on on <unk>
In other words, each one step here is represents an order of a <unk>
So I'm going to talk to you about <unk> curves -- is a novel thing.
Here's something something happen.
And I'm just going to talk to you.
Please switch out the lights.
<unk> more intensity because of writing about paper.
Why is we have <unk> curves at <unk>
The answer is that be any measure of the technology that I would like to do is something like this.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't very much say much.
But if we have some other technology is like -- -- would be very dumb -- would see a straight line.
But if something happens is something like this is a <unk> change.
If we have the technology technology as quickly as we have was in <unk> it would be in in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to go to the rhythm.
There's no <unk> in the history of technological development in history that every few years.
The question I want to do is -- is is -- -- look at is is -- look at is is -- look at is is -- look at is is -- look at is is -- looking to look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't keep in forever.
It is not support this as fast as it goes.
It was set up one of two things.
Or is we going to turn into a typical standard degree -- I know like this until it is to do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm a optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we now would be in the middle of the transition.
In this line we are in a transition of what it used to be in a new form.
So what is what do I try to ask -- and ask myself -- is, what is that a new shape you adopt the world?
How new state is <unk> the world?
The transition seems to seem very confused -- if if we are we are engaged in it.
I remember is the future happen to happen in year when 2000 and people used to happen in in in the year in the year and people remember in in the year in the year and the people used to happen in in in the year in the year and the people used to happen in in in the year in the year and people remember in in the year
This is a one that is people talking about the future and we see the future is still be the year the future is still as we 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year to throughout the year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going to do.
And we can you feel it.
And we know that we have a lot of sense sense of sense of sense of sense of sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how it could be that transition is <unk>
But to do that I will have to talk a very little things to do with technology technology technology.
Because I think the only way to understand that is is to take a distance and look at that is to take you look at that is to take you look at that is to take you look at the long long term.
The scale of the time I would like to do is is is is the time you like to do is is is is is is is is is is is is is the time you like to do is is is is is is is is is is is is the time the life time is on the Earth.
I think this image makes sense sense if we look at you every billion years years.
So we go back about a half billion years ago, when Earth was <unk> around them.
If we look the way those chemicals organized we give us an idea of what things happen.
And I think that is at that time, it was now is floating with a little oil <unk> inside.
Some of you guys had a different combination of chemicals that they gave them to put materials out of the outside of the <unk> and the drops grew up in grew up. up.
And they started <unk>
In a way, those were the more individual forms are more <unk> those oil sheets of oil.
But those blobs are not live in in the current sense, because each one had a single one of them contained -- had a random recipe recipe from of them contained -- had a random recipe recipe to because of them had a random recipe recipe from of of chemicals.
And every one is every time they were <unk> <unk> a chemical distribution of the chemicals that we had.
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the <unk> that we somehow got better to be better at being better at as well as we used to the time to incorporate chemical chemists more chemicals more chemicals in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in
Often they were more <unk> as well.
It was a whole form of life as -- have learned to have learned the trick of you <unk>
In some way that we did not really understand very well as well -- they learned how to store information to be storing information.
They learned how to save information, which was a one one of the recipe from the cell named a a very special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they <unk> in the other evolution as it was to be able to be able to do.
What is the amazing thing is that is that has been stable for since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since it's been stable since
Our genes, our genes, the same is exactly the same same same same same same same same thing.
In fact, every living being is actually expressed with exactly the same same same thing and the letters code.
And one of the things was one of the things that I did is just by <unk> now we can actually write things in with this code.
Here is have a 100 <unk> of white dust who was trying to hide to American people.
But <unk> took this -- the <unk> has the common letters that we used to use in this -- -- -- 10 to the 22 times.
So if anyone wants to be 100 million copies of copies of you for for I have a lot for all of you guys in in in the world and he's here.
If I was a <unk> would you have put in in a virus and it would have spread to the one <unk> in the room.
What was the next thing was <unk>
Writing the DNA was was a very interesting step.
This made this cells be happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things things like things got very different and communicating is that these cells started to exchange and communicate these cells communities communities.
I don't know -- but the bacteria can they exchange for DNA.
In that way, is evolve to evolve antibiotic resistance. resistance.
Some of the bacteria they found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create other bacteria in with other other bacteria and now are many resistant to <unk> because bacteria are communicate.
This is where they were in communities in that they were in and set up a <unk>
From that way, it was <unk> and they were more <unk> and they were <unk> more <unk> and they were <unk> more much more the individuals in the community are <unk> more to all the individuals in the community were <unk> more to the more individual the individuals in the community to <unk> more than it was <unk> more <unk> more than it was <unk> more <unk> more than they
And the point happened is when these communities got got to come so much that they did they came together, and decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided they decided
The next interesting thing for life took to give me another a billion billion years of years.
And at that stage, we have these different communities communities communities communities are these different types and working together as a single organism organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community. community.
We have a lot of cells that they don't are not just act alone.
The skin cell does is not not serve the heart or or so on.
So these were communities evolved and more interesting levels than mobile -- something we call a a different organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these things started with information information about this.
And we can build very special structures that they did not do more things process in the community.
These are these are <unk> structures.
The neurons are are the devices that they process the information -- the information is that the information is that is that is that process the information information that is that the information is that is that is that process the information that the information is that is that is that is that process the information information that is that the information is that those these are built. built.
In fact, they started <unk> in the community being the <unk> structures and understanding and to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system was and the nervous system was and the nervous system was and the nervous system were and the nervous system was and the nervous is and the nervous system was and the nervous system was and the nervous system was and the nervous is and the nervous system was and the nervous system was and the nervous system was and the nervous
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at at that time we <unk> learning was kind to the duration of the organism, is not not to the duration of an evolutionary organism, organism, is not to the duration of an evolutionary organism, organism, not to the duration of an evolutionary country.
So a one could I could, for example, to learn not a certain amount of fruit because they knew the last last time they ate it.
That could actually have learned for for hundreds of years by by the death of years.
So the thing the fact that the fact that the nervous system accelerated it has accelerated the evolutionary process. process.
Because evolution could now happen to confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you needed to be able to learn.
But then, of of course, the individuals they discovered the trick of communication.
So, for for the <unk> version we know is is is the human language.
And if we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
And I have a really complicated idea a idea is <unk> in the head.
I'm sitting here by emitting by emitting <unk> by emitting by emitting by <unk> a <unk> building a <unk> <unk>
But we just took a very complicated thing we made the sound into the sound form, and we produce something very complicated into the other brain.
And now that allows us to start as well as a organism is.
In fact, as humanity, we have started to do <unk>
We now go through with similar periods the similar organisms organisms -- <unk> our data methods, show and information data.
For example, the invention is was a little step in in that direction.
<unk> <unk> the computer tape, <unk> video tape, <unk> and etc. -- are are now we built to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and capable of do before.
Now evolution can you happen in exercises.
You already saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> that was there was a certain other evolution in front of the <unk>
And now we have now accelerated to the time scales again.
The first stages of the story was they told you to tell you a billion years a billion years ago.
The next few of you are stages, the nervous and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the the one is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is and the brain is
So, the ones -- the way -- took less than a million years years.
And there is to have seems to take just a few decades.
The process are <unk> you know, <unk> is is something that <unk> its own word
The more it goes -- it does.
And I think that is what we see in in this is the <unk>
We see that the process is <unk> out.
But I do is I make a a way to design computers -- and I know the mechanisms mechanisms are not going to be possible without the last advances.
But now design are objects objects that would be impossible for me to do is in a conventional way. way.
I don't know each transistor is in that machine connections.
There are billions of millions.
Instead, it is with the designers of the <unk> designers thinking, we think of a level of abstraction, we put this in the machine and a machine does that makes something that makes you much much further away than ever.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting way that I've been using is is is is the same same evolution.
We put up inside of the machine an machine an evolutionary process operates on at the scale of days.
And for all, in the most extreme cases, we can we can evolve a program from from a few instructions.
We say, please. a computer, can you run a hundred million sequences to <unk>
You could actually run these these sequences sequences of <unk> to run all of these programs, that more people want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tell numbers, to give you a simple example.
So we find the programs that you get closer to tidy numbers.
Of course, is a little chances that none of you guys did it.
But luckily, was we actually found two two numbers in in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of of those random sequences that they would better did the <unk> percent of them.
They <unk> those are <unk> the rest of them.
And now do we have the best best asked the numbers. that we would better ordered for.
And let's look at following the <unk> process to the <unk>
Let's take two years, that we are <unk> <unk> the two of them the properties of shows.
So we got a whole new new generation programs programs that had a bit more successfully.
And we say, "Please repeat repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
We have a few mutations in.
And it tries again to do it with another generation.
Well, every generation is take a few generation a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of years of years years in in a few minutes or or in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that was absolutely perfect perfect.
In fact, they are actually programs much more <unk> programs than that I could have written in by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't really say how they work.
I've been trying to have to see how they work.
They're weird programs.
But they actually do they get the <unk> up.
In fact, yes, I have the safety that they got to do is because they come to a hundreds of thousands of programs that they did as well.
In fact, their lives lives in there.
Once I was in a <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It says, <unk> has has hundreds of thousands of you who work together to give you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes do not work very well when we got complicated.
So that's why is we begin to rely on computers to do very different design.
And that allows us to produce much more more more different than them that produces the normal means. engineering.
But we don't really understand about all the choices choices you are.
In front of in front of us.
Now we use these programs to make computers much more programs much more much more programs in now.
I mean, it is <unk>
The thing is going to be faster and that's why I think it seems as <unk>
Because of all of these technologies are <unk> up.
We're <unk>
And we're at in the one of the organisms in when they got out of <unk>
We're <unk> and we can't really understand what the hell we're creating.
We're just at the point.
But I think something is coming behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part part of you think we are are in the end of the evolution.
And I think that we all are we are are part of the creation of what creation is what it is to come.
But now I think I stop here before I was <unk> me.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been <unk> enough time enough to let me to give you a part of you a part of my fake <unk>
Before I was in my talk, the subject is to talk a very theme of <unk>
Why is not?
We are close to the end, it is is is to be is to go to you is to you is to you is is to you is to you is to you is is to you is to you is to you is is to you is to you is to you is is to you is to you is to you is is to is to you is
We love a baseball, right?
baseball is full of of amazing statistics.
There are there are hundreds of statistics.
It's just about <unk> the <unk> are talking about the statistics and <unk>
I'm just focusing on one one and I hope many many of you have heard of.
It's called average <unk>
And we are talking about in a <unk> that you <unk> 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three is 10 times.
That means is to be throw you a <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know what you call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team team team.
You know what you call a <unk> baseball <unk> of <unk>
By the way, -- is somebody that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that of you that
<unk> as the legendary Williams, is the last last last <unk> player in <unk>
Now I <unk> this to my world where I feel so much more awkward, after after after after that, when I will tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> are <unk> and they are <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
This is not work, right?
Now suppose are you live in in a long place, and a person will being is going to have two <unk> <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting much better at this year.
And the <unk> have has been <unk>
This is not work.
But I'll ask you what to ask them.
What do you think the average <unk> of the heart surgeon, or <unk>
It was very good.
And the truth is that one one is in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of you in all of in the medicine
What we do, however, is to send me in the world, and myself included, with the case of be in with the mandate to be perfect.
You would never, ever make a a good thing to try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was going to go to when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was at when I was was
I was was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Once, a young mate said that said that was studied to for a blood tests.
Such well.
I was in in my little <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
And I learned all of the memory.
From my <unk> are the origin and the <unk> is <unk> every single single artery that comes out of the <unk> political diagnosis is not <unk>
And I even knew the difference I was about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And much more they are we understood more and deeper and more knowledge. more knowledge.
And I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the drug school medicine is that if you got to get the close close to the everything, because I was scared to me.
And it worked for for a time, until I met the lady <unk>
I was was in a university hospital hospital here in Toronto, here in Toronto was where I was working at.
At that time, I was assigned to the <unk> service I was assigned to <unk>
And when I was requested to go to a way to the patient to me.
He will reporting the head of the residents. they will and report the head boss to the residents.
When I saw the <unk> was <unk> was a <unk>
I heard about a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> was I was heard about a <unk> sound, sound on in both of the one was a <unk> heart failure.
In these are these conditions in the heart stops working on, and instead of the blood goes up to the lungs, these are <unk> of the blood blood, and that's why is there a hard to breathe.
And it was not not be <unk>
I did it, and I got to go to work in in the treatment to work out at the treatment.
I gave him <unk> and medication for medication to give it the pressure on the heart.
I gave him <unk> water water -- so that could be made out of a liquid.
And in one time or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very good.
And that was when I made the first <unk> sent to his home.
Actually, I actually made a two more more.
He sent up her to not talk to the head of they had not talk to the head of the residents.
I didn't not get up the phone -- I didn't do what I should have done, that I was to call my <unk> and <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, would have been able to have been able to be able to have been able to be able to have been able to be able to have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Maybe I did it for for a good reason.
Maybe I did not want to be a number a resident to pay constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be as successful and be able to take care of my patients in without even touching my boss.
The second thing that I made was was was was was was was did that worse.
When I send it to your home, not not give you not give a attention to a a voice to me, is not not a good idea.
In fact, it was well not that I was asked about the nurse that was to take care to the <unk> who is the <unk>
And the nurse was thinking about and utter that I will be right."
I remember that as it was was yesterday.
So she signed up the high and the ambulance took her to their home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, day, that day, afternoon, I got a bad <unk> in in the stomach,
But but I went up with my job.
At the end of the day, he was -- to go to the one to leave the hospital and walked into the time to go home at at the time.
It went through the road service at home.
And there is another a nurse, -- not that that I was taking care of the old <unk> to me three other words -- that was three words that was most medical doctors doctors.
Other people can people fear it as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk>
The three words are, you know?
He remembers of the patient who sent to his <unk> the patient who sent to his <unk> in the patient.
I asked the other other they asked her other other other other <unk> <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same same same voice.
She was fine.
But I came up and on the edge of death.
After one time I had got to have come to her -- after it was to him, was a family and her family suffered a family and her family suffered a family and her family suffered a family and her family suffered a family and her family suffered a family and her family suffered a family and her family suffered a family and her family suffered a family and her
I just was just was was blue.
The whole staff staff will <unk> all of the resources. out.
They gave you medication to raise the blood pressure for <unk>
And they got it a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
I had a mixture of feelings because it was after it was -- was in it in in in in it in a whole hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days days, that we never did to do.
He had a permanent harm damage.
The family got together.
And in in the eight or nine days, were <unk> what was I was going for.
And the was the ninth ninth day, it was go. <unk> wife, and <unk>
They say they never forget the names are they die.
That was the first experience. experience.
The time was the weeks weeks to me -- for me for for that and I was first experienced with the <unk> which is and I sat out alone, of <unk> without not feel that healthy <unk>
You will actually make you make peace up, and never makes that error.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame is that I'm talking about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It is not tell us not that that is what we did was were wrong, but we're bad.
And what did I feel like that.
And it was not not for my <unk> he was was <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I going to go to the things and made sure I didn't get to do the thing to do.
And I kept out of those questions.
Why did I not ask how I asked my <unk> why not sent it home?
And in my <unk> why I made a such thing as <unk>
Why is we choose <unk>
Little soon was that feeling was was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in a day day, it was opened up the sky and the sky came to myself, if I would feel better at me.
And I made a deal with myself in that that if I was going to go to the efforts to do it care?
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it went to happen.
Two years later, I was a <unk> in the community hospital in north and I got a <unk> man in with a throat.
I was really busy and <unk>
And he was pointed out here.
I looked up his throat, was a little <unk>
He <unk> penicillin at his home.
But while he was led to the door was still pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> in your office.
And I made the three words -- <unk>
Remember the patient as he was saw for a pain pain in <unk>
Well, he came up and did not have an <unk> <unk>
I had an condition potentially called <unk>
You can do is Google. -- it's an infection, not because it can cause the close one you go. is.
He, <unk> not passed away.
You are told you to get antibiotics antibiotics in <unk> and he's recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same same kind of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and came to me, and went to work, until it happened again and over and again and again and again.
Two times are in the same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same
And it's a great effort to especially work in in the same time.
But in both of these cases, I not sent to home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of the people thought I had a <unk> calculation means.
He took an an X-ray but it turned normal.
The other one was a lot of diarrhea.
I read the liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk>
I checked and at it, and when you got to notice a certain sensitivity sensitivity is in the right right looks at that and when you got to notice a certain sensitivity sensitivity in the right law, I called the surgeon surgeon.
They were both operated <unk>
But every single one is <unk> me <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst other mistakes mistakes in the first first five years and many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most significant things have to have been for for for the last five years.
They are embarrassed not <unk> and not support.
And here's the problem: if I can't I go to that and talk about and talk about how to tell me what it says to me.
How do I teach them that to not for they not make the same <unk> themselves.
If I would go to a place like this one, it has no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time is you heard to talk about a time to go to someone talk about after after <unk>
Of course of course, is to talk about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll just talk about someone talking about the other talking about their own own usual mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in <unk> the wrong thing would have been a hard time difficulty
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system that we are are great outcomes.
And it's kind of like that as they start to attack that person's person.
We have the idea that if we do is if we do the medicine medicine for people who make mistakes are safe.
But that brings two to two problems.
In about 20 years, about about about about about about about about about about most <unk> and journalism,
And what I learned is is is that the mistakes are are <unk>
We work out in the day that the mistakes are in the day we were in in the hospital are in <unk> in the hospital in which the infections are more and more <unk> cause them.
In this country, they dying 24 Canadian for <unk> for <unk>
The United Institute was established 100,000.
In both of these cases, it is as well as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> where is the knowledge is is multiply every two to three or three years or three years to us.
<unk> <unk>
And we can't really get rid of in and can't get rid of that is and we can't get rid of it.
We have to have got cognitive biases allow to allow you to do a perfect history record of a patient.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not the same same story.
I'm not not do things always as well.
And my patients are are not <unk> their symptoms -- not in the same same same same same way.
For all of all, the mistakes are are inevitable.
So if we were <unk> and we <unk> all of the professionals as likely to be any other.
And about that is that people don't want to be talking about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> art is is a custom worst <unk>
And their students are <unk> <unk> <unk> their head and saliva is and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share with them.
<unk> can you be able to say, say, "Look, don't they make the same same <unk>
They need a context to be able to be able to do.
They need a <unk> medical culture. culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is to learn about what they happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It is support about their mistakes.
We <unk> the mistakes of other people would not want to do it for <unk> but a <unk> and support way they all got to be.
And it works is in the medical culture that recognizes we actually recognize that humans human beings are run in the system, and when this happens, are mistakes in time in then.
My name is is, Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, make a mistakes in <unk>
And I feel so much a thing to be trying to learn something something can be convey to others.
I don't still know -- but can I live with that.
And let me just close with with three words -- I can remember.
Do you know how much decisions we take a <unk> day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week? week?
I recently did a survey more than 2,000 people and the average choices he says to choose a average American American, are about 70 a day.
Not a long way a lot went for for a week to a group to a research group for for a week of research.
The researchers recorded the different different tasks and the time we can <unk> in making decisions more about to do with <unk>
They found out that, on on on on on on on on on on on on on average, -- <unk> <unk>
Naturally, every work was a whole bunch of <unk>
Half of those decisions are decisions took was nine minutes or so.
Only about 12 percent required an hour or over time.
Now think about your election.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> <unk>
How is the way the way to deal those <unk> those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one is one of the biggest problems issues like to choose to choose you to choose any other overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this is to ask you a few questions and I need to know about your answers.
When I am I am -- -- as I am I am a <unk> raise your hand only one is only if you want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to do want to
Otherwise, when you make a question -- if if your answer is you to be positive please give you <unk>
And now is my first first question on the day, are are ready to hear about the problem with <unk>
Thank you.
Being a <unk> student at at at at the University of at the University University, the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of at the University of
It was called <unk>
It was almost like go to an amusement park.
There was as we made water water.
I loved going to go to that store, but I was one one needs to me, -- why did I never buy nothing? do?
This is this is be this the <unk> oil shelf in <unk> in <unk>
They had more much more than 75 different classes, including the ones that they were in <unk> trees.
Once I decided to go to the manager and asked him, <unk> this is all these <unk>
He was pointed to signal the buses of the buses was full of the buses the buses with the buses with the buses with the buses filled with the <unk> buses pulled out the days around the days, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to make a one small little experiment on with <unk> this is is this.
<unk>
They had to have a different kinds of things.
He <unk> right at the gate of the store.
We put it out of that six <unk> or we looked at two things:
More people at the time to be <unk> a 40 percent.
We also looked at why you more likely to buy an jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From the ones who was stopped when it was 24, only three percent had got to buy <unk>
From the ones who stood up when I had six, we saw that the 30 percent bought the 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the people, people had six times six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, decide not to decide we not buy <unk> you probably is to keep you the problem that the problem appears to affect us.
We decided not to not decide, even do that we have we come up to us.
Now the subject is the subject to the financial is issue is the financial of the day, the day.
I'm going to describe a a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were interested in interested in to see whether we were interested in to see if the number of need available to be saving for people to save for people.
And we found that I was really -- was a <unk> one <unk>
We had plans to go from the two to up to up to the different options.
And we found that the bigger it was it was -- there was be less participation as we as did that were <unk>
So if we look at what the plans to you see that the plans to the rate of you as they wanted to.
And in the plans that would I was offered about about <unk> the rate of involvement went to the <unk> percent <unk> percent of you to be offered to the rate of involvement went to the <unk> percent <unk> percent of you to have happened to the <unk> percent of you to go to the U.S. years?
It turns out that it turns out, that if you decide to participate, when there is more choices -- even you decide when you decide to participate, when there's more is there is more choices even you decide when you decide -- when you decide to participate, when there is more choices are there is more choices even you decide when you decide -- when you you decide to participate,
So, for the people who they decided to participate, the bigger the older it was is the greater it was the more people to avoid stocks or hedge funds.
As soon as they were they were more willing to be able to invest in in the market.
But none of these are you are going to do to protect the future financial well-being. future.
In the previous decade, we have seen these three main negative consequences to offer you more more negative consequences to deliver more to offer more more.
The most likely thing is we have the decision to go against <unk>
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in in finance and health.
They are more likely to choose things less <unk> even even <unk> things like that.
The main reason is you have to look at that you can look at that you look at that you can look at that you look at that you can look at that of you at that you can see that that is looking to that of you at that you can look at that of you at that you look at that of you at that you look at
Today I want to do is to do is -- four simple simple techniques we had in one way or another, in so they can can use in their businesses.
The first one is is, are <unk>
You already heard that before, -- but has never been more about that today, today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that is today, that
People are always upset about when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space space space.
But actually, what is we are seeing is what we are seeing is more about is that if you choose to get rid of <unk> choices.
When I was <unk> to <unk> it went to the country it went to the country it went to the country it went out of the <unk> different types of <unk> <unk> did you see the increase in a sales.
When the <unk> <unk> just eliminated the products in <unk>
You know that the supermarket supermarkets supermarkets <unk> on average in average, give us 45,000 to provide 45,000 products.
A was in a recorded grocery store are offered about about 100,000 products.
But the the one is the big ninth department is in the current world is on on a tin.
In the world of the financial savings, I think that one of the best few examples are examples have emerged about is is is is is is is is is is is is is is the <unk> <unk>
All of the <unk> employees are are <unk> automatically at a full range of life.
And the people really want to choose, are were offering them to be for them 20 <unk> not 300 or more.
You already know people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are all are are <unk> options.
The first first thing that I do is is, ask the <unk> the differences that we are there is in between other options.
And if your employees can't do they do their <unk> in the <unk> either.
And this was before I started this session, I was talking about <unk>
He said to me that I would be willing to give people the people in the audience to the people in the <unk> most paid on the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to you, and then I want to give you a round of <unk>
You have any one thing is to accept the supply.
Are they not be more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a <unk> was a trick.
Who is ready for for that journey?
I really think that I was really going to hit the hands of hands.
All right.
Actually, you really had more information in that in that in that in the second time was more time.
Because the images were making it become more real.
This is me a second to me to drive the problem problem to drive the problem problem.
For people that people understand the differences you have to understand the consequences of every choice, and the consequences should you feel very much <unk>
Why is people spend 15 to 30 to 30 30 percent more on average in average when it uses is <unk>
Because it doesn't seem like real money.
It turns out, it turns out that it was look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the meeting that I was <unk> exactly how we got -- we made a very little <unk>
What we would have was to do is is that we got the people to the staff who would think about the positive things -- in their lives if they would <unk> in their lives if they can think about in their lives if they would think about in their lives more money.
With this <unk> there was as well as they wanted to put in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is is <unk>
We can we run more to more categories than options.
For example, this is for this is a study that we did in a hall aisle
We looked at that in the <unk> supermarket <unk> <unk> can they hold from <unk> different different types.
But you know?
Because the <unk> tell me how to <unk>
These are these two pieces of <unk>
One is one is one is one the other, are <unk>
If you think the one on the left is is <unk> and the one is on the right is is is to give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is is <unk> and the one is on the right is is is to give you a <unk>
Okay, much more.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the one is on the left is is <unk> and the one is on the right is is is is -- it <unk>
This is a whole kind of is totally useless.
categories.
You often see this a problem with these enormous lists lists lists of this.
I will not mean who you are <unk> for.
My fourth <unk> is <unk> <unk>
It turns out that we can actually drive a much more information information than we thought -- can only do it -- a little bit.
We've got to increase the incremental complexity we need to use.
I'm going to show you an example of what I want to say.
Let's look at a good <unk> the purchase of a car.
This is is a very full <unk> manufacturer of cars.
You have to take 60 decisions, to go to build the car.
And these are decisions are in in in the number of choices choices to do.
<unk> color in the car is -- have 56 possibilities.
It was <unk> <unk> four options.
What is what I'm going to do is to change the order in which the decisions are like.
So the half of the clients are going to be going to go to a lot of choices 56 color are just about four boxes.
Half of the clients are going to go in a few options, options, four are a lot of options.
And what am I going to do it?
So what are involved in with.
If you <unk> the a default button on every decision, this is indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> are the being lost.
We find that the ones who go in a lot of choices choices -- the <unk> button and over again and again, and more else.
We <unk>
If you go in a few choices choices -- if they are they go on there.
Same is the same same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order in which the information comes to do.
If we started the easy, you learn how to <unk>
Even though is we choose the information box doesn't do nothing about about the <unk>
We have a product that we are building us now has more engaged us more engaged in now.
So to do that sum up.
I've been talking about to mitigate the problem of the overload overload we are going to do this -- -- -- <unk> we can we can drive more <unk>
All of these techniques that I would have introduced you to help you manage to manage the <unk> or better, for them to be used for them in their business, or for people who do.
It's that I think that I think the key to get the best best in the way is is is to be careful about <unk>
And the more you can you more careful we will be in our better choices can we be able to be able to have a choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years in <unk> in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a one of you had a writing was <unk> in the government.
It was to register a text of text text with the machine.
And this is for what the government could they track the origin of you are <unk>
If they had a written with the wrong message they could actually track the footprint to the point of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this -- -- -- freedom of of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a one one is a little pattern makes you like.
That's what's happening today.
And nobody seems to do is a lot of for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments governments use the technology against technology against against the citizens. technology.
And it's one of the three major causes cause of issues.
If we look what's in in the world online world, we can put together the attacks according to as it is in the online world can we can put together the attacks according to as it is in the online world can we can put together the attacks according to the attacks of as they are in the <unk>
There's three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in <unk> in in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys are they make money.
They use the <unk> to win a lot of money, huge amounts to do.
There is really many cases in online -- <unk> which would you provide money out of money for attacks.
This is is <unk> <unk>
This is -- is -- <unk>
This is Stephen <unk> this is this.
This is <unk> <unk>
These are these are these are these are <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do are they make their online <unk> but they made it for illegal by <unk> banking to <unk>
The U.S. was the U.S. secret service two months ago, <unk> was the U.S. account of this sir, Sam <unk>
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know know you left.
And I say that today is be a victim of the <unk> than any of us is is a victim of a <unk> than any of us is to be a victim of you is is a victim of a <unk> a real real crime. crime.
And it's very obvious thing that is going to be wrong for worse.
In the future, the majority of people in online.
The second second group of <unk> in the importance that we are looking at today is not is not be is not driven by for the money. money.
There's another other thing to motivate them to motivate you motivate you motivate you feelings.
groups as Anonymous are have have been <unk> in the last 12 months in the online attacks.
Those are the three are the criminals are criminals who do they do it for for the <unk> as Anonymous are they made it to protest and and the last group is are the U.S. are the United national the national the U.S. America.
And then we are seeing cases like the <unk> <unk>
That's a good example example of the government attack against against its own citizens. itself.
<unk> is is an <unk> authority, or actually, it was.
They <unk> the last fall because of the last fall due to a <unk>
You were <unk> to the safety of the site and puts out a <unk>
So I was at the last week I asked him, at a meeting with the government representatives for Dutch government asked for one of the people to because of the people who causes people to cause the death of the death to the death of the death to the death of the death as to do.
And the answer is it was yes.
So how do people die about a cause of these?
<unk> is you an official authority.
<unk> <unk>
So why are you serve the <unk> they serve them?
Well, you need you need to have a site with <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we will <unk> a foreign authority official <unk>
And they were <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case case was you know exactly what it happened.
And what happened in the Arab <unk> and those things have happened -- for for example, in <unk>
Well, in the <unk> the <unk> protesters the <unk> headquarters was they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was in is this folder called <unk>
And within that folder was the notes of the citizens in the country.
They had been sold to you for the <unk> euros euros to the <unk> government.
The company is right right here.
I mean, Western governments can provide the tools tools for you to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also done to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just for a couple of weeks it was found out of the <unk> and used by government officials was used by government officials was used by government officials was used by government officials was used by government officials was used by government officials was used by government officials was used by government officials was used by government officials was used by government officials was used by
If you is <unk> in a very good criminal case, it's quite obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today is be more in there.
They <unk> the connection to the Internet.
We <unk> even tools like <unk> to infect us infect our computer to the <unk> to allow them to see the all of the communication and listen to get our data.
When we think closely things like this is the very obvious answer should we look like a bad <unk>
Why is you <unk>
I don't have nothing you <unk>
And that argument doesn't really make a sense.
It's in the game of it.
Privacy is not be <unk> up.
It's not not a matter of privacy against safety.
It is be about freedom in <unk>
If we have to trust our governments today in 2011, it will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future future, in a management of the future that we might have in in in <unk>
These are the questions are to us in in in the next 50 <unk> years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south of <unk> in Park.
These are these are my father -- at the end, the bottom of the cows, the <unk> share of the other.
The National Park Park Park, you got no awful animals as <unk> migrate to freely as <unk> animals in <unk>
And predators, like the lions are they follow them, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at at the night, and as soon is we get up in in the morning and we found it dead to because I was the only poster we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came in in the sky and the land is to go for -- and why we value the much.
So I grew up with -- much a lot of <unk>
They were people dying to protect our community and won, and they're very annoying with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is because of this is as few in in Yellowstone National Park Park in which is I think of this is as few in in Yellowstone National Park Park in the other are there are in in in the National Park Park Park Yellowstone National Park Park in the way, Nairobi.
One was a kid in my community, in the age to the age of the age of the age at the age of the age was the nine to the age of the <unk> is is responsible for me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first first idea was to use fire, because I was thought about the lions were afraid to be afraid.
But I really realized that this is not be <unk> because even the way the way it was away.
I don't have been <unk> me.
One is a second idea was to use one <unk>
And I was trying to believe that was about to the <unk>
But the lions are are very smart, is always here.
So one night I was just walking around the pen with a little night, lions lions didn't come meet.
I found out that lions are are really afraid of fear the light that it moves. around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to turn it into and shut out the lights.
And this is this is a small little lamp lamp <unk>
He <unk> everything.
As you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can can you like.
And <unk> box does that makes the light lights them.
As you can you can you can you come the lions.
And this is how do you see when they are <unk> lions when they come up at the evening.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> the lions are lions come up with the <unk> but I'm sleeping in in the bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, two years years ago, we never had we never got a problem with the problems with <unk>
And the house houses were you heard about the idea.
One is one of you is is this a <unk> of them.
She had had been a lot of a lot of animals many animals and lions and lions are lions and asked me if I could actually put the lights.
I said, yeah.
You can see in the back, these are the lights lights up.
Since then, I've set up at seven houses in in the community and they're serving a very big way.
And my idea is also be used to <unk> elephants for farms.
And thank you for this -- I was fortunate to be able to get a grant to have a great best big schools in African Kenya, Kenya, School, and I'm very excited.
My own school is now is helping you to raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends in and installed lights in the houses houses are they taught them.
So, one was a year -- was just a little kid in in the grasslands, meadows and he was used to see that one one day it would be within a one.
And here I am. today.
I got the opportunity opportunity to come in a <unk>
My great dream is to get to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be
I used I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is is saving to the lions lions lions are.
<unk> <unk> what do in my language means -- what is in my very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> not do that the exciting is how exciting is you to listen to a story like you.
So you got you got to get a <unk> <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other other electrical <unk>
What's the next one is in your list?
<unk> the next next was -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
<unk> I know you were already invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I was just at once, once, a time, once, a time, once, is -- once, a time, once, a time, once, is once, a time, once, is --  <unk>
Let's <unk> in every step that <unk> a friend is.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
And when I was a little, was I thought that my country was the best on the best on the best on best on best on the best on the best on best on best on the best on the best on best on best on the best on the best on best on best on the best on the best on best on best on the best.
I grew up and singing a a called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would go all the time by studying the history of the world except except the rest of the rest of the world except except we learned a lot of a lot of the rest the rest of the world except except we learned a lot of a lot of the rest the rest of the world except except we learned a lot of a lot of the
I was wondering about the rest of the world, world, to think that I would happen all of my life changed changed.
When I was seven years, I saw is my first first public execution of years.
But but I thought that my life in North Africa was as well.
My family was not never been hungry.
But one day in in 1995, in 1995, -- my mom brought home a letter a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we got to do this, the five members of the family will we stop there in in the world, because we haven't eaten in two two weeks.
We are <unk> together in on the ground, and our bodies are are ready to die."
I was really <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were were suffering in suffering in in my country.
At the time, when I was in front of the <unk> I saw something terrible terrible that I can't get.
A was a woman without life was not being able to do anything.
No one is them -- because they were very concerned about to take care to care themselves and their families.
A huge enormous amount of <unk> to North Korea in North the <unk> in the <unk> to in the <unk>
In the end, the more over a million North America died during it was died of eating grass, insects and insects and blue cortex.
They also became more -- the <unk> the <unk> all around it was all around it was in all around it was in all around it was with all around you all around it was in all around it was just around in at night except for the light lights lights.
I always wondered why why they didn't <unk> and we don't.
This is this is a one is this one is a whole picture of North Korea on the night with the <unk>
This is this is the <unk> river serves the North and China.
As you can you can you can be very <unk> in a certain points, allowing allowing North <unk> crossing in <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I would see bodies floating in in the <unk>
I can't really reveal the the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details
But I just thought that it would be separate from my family for <unk>
I never could ever have imagined that it was to go back to the <unk>
In China, it was very hard to live as a young woman was without no family <unk>
I had no idea what life would be as a refugee <unk> in <unk> had no idea.
But I soon I learned that it's not only be extremely hard, but it's also dangerous, because the poor refugees North American refugees in China was as dangerous, illegal migrants for in China as well.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity is to be <unk> to a a <unk> <unk>
One was a day, my worst worst thing was made was when I was arrested for me at the police station. station.
Somebody was <unk> to be <unk> then I was <unk> my my skills in the Chinese language and made me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought to think that my heart goes to exploit.
If I didn't look like it natural, could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought that my life was in in end.
But yet I got to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the <unk> one official said to the other, is it be a <unk>
And he was left to go. This was a <unk>
Some North Africa are looking for <unk> in <unk>
But many are many people can to be arrested for the Chinese police and the Chinese police and the Chinese police and Chinese police are the Chinese police and the Chinese police and the Chinese people are and <unk> are the Chinese police and the Chinese police and Chinese police are the Chinese police and Chinese police are the Chinese police and the Chinese police and the Chinese the Chinese
These women were very lucky.
Even though was they had had been <unk> they eventually come up after after a harsh lasts country.
These North North they didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless Koreans are are captured in China in <unk> <unk>
Although I was <unk> many other other other people have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that the North States have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after we learn a whole new language language, everything can <unk> in in right now.
That's why is that that after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to put up going to South Korea.
And I started a whole new life over again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much better challenge for what I had expected.
The English was very important to in South Korea, I had to start learning about my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap is between North and South to the other.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of in the <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? <unk> am I?
Suddenly there was not be a country I could ever call with a pride of mine.
Although I was in South Korea was not so easy, -- made a plan.
Just when was I was started to go to my <unk> my new life, life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities to <unk> some of the money to be moved to the force to be moved to the force to be moved to the <unk> location.
They had to run away immediately immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North America have got to travel long distances at the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border border of of the North and South in the South.
So, ironically, I took up to China and <unk> to the border with North Korea.
Since my family could not speak to it in somehow -- for somehow, for over over a thousand miles across across across through through across the China and then through the coast of Asia.
The trip in <unk> took a a week, and almost went to be caught at a different times.
Once, our was stopped and stopped and was a shot of the Chinese police officer.
He was asked of you all of and they started to ask questions.
As I was as my family was no family was going to be <unk>
When I was in the Chinese official came to my family <unk> I was told him that they were <unk> <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but I fortunately I did.
We <unk> all the way to the <unk> border.
But but I had to spend almost almost all of my money to do to do that for <unk> <unk>
But even after the split is my family was was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border.
After you were paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in in a month.
But at the time, my family was was was arrested for me, and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lower dots points in in in in in my life.
I made all of you to liberate my family, and we were so close to the family was <unk> in prison in prison.
I was and went between the immigration office and the police station, police station, trying to try to liberate my family.
But it was not had enough money to pay more money to pay more money money to pay more money to pay more money money to pay more money money to pay more money to pay more money money to pay more money money to pay more money to pay more money money to pay more money money to pay more money to pay more money money to pay more
I lost hope.
At the time, or a voice of ask myself, "What is the problem?"
I was really impressed for asking.
With my poor poor, and with a man was explaining to the <unk>
I was <unk> with all of my heart, and asked him, "Why <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the <unk> people.
I realized that was that was be a symbolic moment in in my life.
The kind of <unk> a new hope for me and for <unk> when it was <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of the unknown and the support community is are really the hope that the people are <unk> needs.
Over the time, after our long long long trip, my family and we met in in the South Korea.
But get their freedom is is only half the battle.
Many Koreans are are separated from their families in when they went to a little money.
So therefore we can we benefit out of the international community with by education, practice practices in <unk> and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North and the rest of the world.
Because many many of us are still in in in contact with family family -- that is helping to change North Korea in North Korea.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration of <unk>
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North America in all over the world, including including at the TED stage. stage.
Thank you.
I live in South America.
This is is the <unk> stores stores food, <unk>
Then the city planners got together -- and they thought, are we going to change the other way to the whole changed thing they changed in the city.
This is is the South L.A.  <unk>
Just like it <unk> million of other Americans live in in the <unk>
What is the curious thing is is that is that the food sites are to have kills people more people killed than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the South African diseases in the South African diseases in the South African diseases were in the South African diseases in the South African diseases were in the South African diseases in the South African diseases were in the South African diseases in the South African diseases.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is is is about to 15 miles away.
I just see that this is happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel like it, if they didn't have no access access to the healthy food, if if they go out of the home effects, that the current food system has is in the current food system to you.
I look at the <unk> wheels and sold as <unk> cars.
I saw <unk> <unk> like Starbucks.
And I think that is to stop.
I think the problem is is is the solution.
The food is is the problem that solution.
And then I got tired to get tired to buy a apple that's not <unk>
What I did, was was plant a food forest in front of the home.
In one of the land that we call a one <unk> <unk>
It's just about 45 meters x feet me.
The point is is, belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can make what you come to me -- because it's my responsibility and I have to do.
So that's how I decided to go about it.
So my was my group of and I, L.A. we put together and plant our together and plant our together our forest of food, trees trees trees trees trees -- you know, the nine <unk> are <unk>
What we do, are we are a kind of a paid group as long as long ago we go ahead to as long it was as long as long ago we go ahead to as long it made as much as long ago we go ahead to as long made as far is as far as much as long ago we go ahead to as long was as much as
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone was <unk> up.
The city got to me on top and a <unk> got me a <unk> by saying that I had to take my <unk> the <unk> became a <unk> <unk>
And I said, "Come to you?
A is a <unk> command food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- was kind of, <unk>
Because it's not going to happen.
The L.A. Times has had the story had been written by by by by -- and one of the <unk> members who was put a <unk> <unk>
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even <unk> the thing we were doing.
I mean, do -- why not?
L.A. is is with more <unk>
It's got <unk> miles in <unk>
That's the equivalent of <unk>
That's not space space to plant -- <unk> million <unk> plants million <unk>
Why do it not seem good like this.
They <unk> a a thousand a thousand a thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar is <unk> to you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I say to people, you cultivate your food.
You will take your own own food is is to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy is for South America.
I grew up there, -- <unk> my kids in there.
I was in <unk> to being part of this is <unk> which was <unk> for me for for for each other and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is is my <unk> in our culture, my art.
This is like an artist artist <unk> <unk> soils, me do we have <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, land, like a piece piece of the plants are are the <unk> of the <unk>
You would you be surprised to see what the land can actually do. if they let it be to do.
You just can't imagine how amazing is is -- how does it affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed the how my garden became became a design tool, of the transformation of the neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects the guys.
<unk> is that you can do to do, especially in a <unk>
And addition, they get <unk> up.
And I remember one one was a mother and her daughter, <unk> to the night and they were in in the night and they were in the night and they were on the night and they were on the night and were in in the night and was left out of the <unk>
I, well, man, was I felt wrong that you were in there, and I was told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to when we saw people who was as close to see people who was as close to me with hungry, and it just <unk> the why why are people go to steal the people.
What I say, <unk> not fear that you are going to go to <unk>
So it's in the street.
That's what is about.
I want to do that a <unk> but at his time, I want I want to go to <unk> your <unk>
There was another time I put a garden in a <unk> shelter shelter at at the center of <unk>
They were guys who helped me to download the truck.
It was also gave me his story about as it was just for a moment.
So, <unk> <unk> has been to plant maybe 20 garden garden garden <unk>
We have had to be like about 50 people to come, work and <unk> all of the volunteers.
If kids are they grow the kids -- the kids are the kids.
If you are <unk> will you eat <unk> --  but if none of you are -- are told you, how the food affects your mind affects your mind the mind affect the mind affects your mind affect the food, and the body affects affect you, the food affects affect the food affect the mind and the body affects your food affect your food affects your mind the mind affect
I look at young people who wants to work, but have this this thing in which is that is designed for them to not take it nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity I can can train these kids who could we train these kids to be aware of their communities out of in their communities to have a communities to be aware of in their communities to be aware of.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe we have the next George George <unk> was <unk>
But if we don't change the ground, our land, we never will. are we never do that?
Now this is one of my course -- this is something like to do.
I want to plant all a whole block, of gardens, where people can people share food in the same ends.
I want to go to turn them in into <unk>
I didn't <unk>
I'm not talking about for free, because it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What is I talk about to be working on to the people, people to take the kids out of the guys to meet the guys in and the honor to grow their own food, opened the farmers. markets
What I want to do here, we have to do it sexy.
I want to all become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what you is is to be <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you go to take your <unk> all right?
That is be their weapon in choice.
In <unk> if they want to meet with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with
If you want to see me, come up the garden with your <unk> so we could we plant something.
Peace <unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> percent of you all will agree that this is is a very nice road.
It's actually made out of the <unk> and the asphalt is a good thing to drive but not always in the days as it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of you have a lot of water in in the asphalt <unk> you <unk>
And especially if they go on in your bicycle and cars -- that is not very nice.
And addition, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a kind of a particularly loud material, and if we we built the way to the cities, we would want a silent road road <unk>
The solution to do is is to do roads roads <unk>
The asphalt is the entire water water water flow out of water.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk> <unk>
Because it's all because of all of the noise -- so is a road very silent road.
It also has <unk> are <unk> you can <unk>
What is you <unk> you look like that on this is the stones in the surface is out of the <unk>
And first a first was a stone, then several more and more more and more, more, and forth, are not going to do that.
And finally, this can also lead to more harm and damage.
Sometimes, they can make you fit with that.
Oh. It's just smart.
<unk> of course, that you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see what the damage appears to the damage the material.
It's a <unk> as I said, just is a little number amount of <unk>
Because of because of you <unk> the light to the <unk> this is <unk> it is <unk> the <unk>
So, if you drive on the road, you go to the <unk> as we saw it here.
To do this a problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make that material are <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use these little little bits bits bits of pieces up.
So we are asphalt are little bits of steel steel in there.
Then you need a machine, like the one you can see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can you open up, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what is you what you have to do is is is to heat the steel to melt the <unk> by the <unk> the <unk> flow by by <unk> the <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> by the <unk> by <unk> by the <unk> by <unk> by the <unk> by <unk> by the <unk> by <unk> by the <unk> by <unk> by the <unk> by <unk> by the <unk>
It was used to a <unk> because I can't I bring the great big <unk> machine here.
The microwave oven, is is a similar system.
I put the show, that now I'm just take you to see what it happened.
This is this is the one that comes is right now.
I said we have this kind has this kind of machine machines in the lab to in order to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there and then then the government, actually did we have to <unk>
So we donated a donated to the <unk> highway highway, in which we had to make a a test lane to try this material.
So that's what we really know about practice.
We took a lot of samples out of this is and we tested in in the lab.
We did that age -- age age that age -- that age is age, we put a lot of load into them, all of and we went to it.
We can do this a whole bunch of times.
Well, I can I say that we have made a material actually save a lot of money on very simple.
And now, of all, of you are curious about if this was also work.
We still have this shown here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool up before you before I can you just cool up before you before I can you like it to be just cool at before I can you can show you how to do it pollen.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years I can I remember have I woken up to have woken to have a <unk> with the <unk> sound.
My father was was listening for, News in his little little gray radio. radio.
I had a great smile in his face which was unusual at the time, because the news is usually <unk>
The Taliban was laughing at her, as my dad.
I didn't not know what to do, but I could see that my father was was very, very happy.
"Now is you go to a <unk> school, he said.
One would you never forget.
A real school. school.
You see, I was was six years when the Taliban were <unk> to the girls to be school.
For the next to the next five years, years, I became as a as a child to <unk> my older sister who could not only be used to be used to be used to alone -- to go to a <unk>
It was the only way that we got two to them -- was the only one way that we were two could both of them to do.
Every day, we took a different route for that no one one could be suspect about where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in the market so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a home, over more a hundred them up in a small room.
It was kind to be nice in the winter, but extremely <unk>
We all knew what are we were, the <unk> our students and our parents were parents.
At the time, the school had to be a week, because a week, because the Taliban <unk> <unk>
We always wondered what they knew they knew they knew.
They were <unk> us.
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but even school where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in where education was to be <unk> and the daughters are <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man to for his time.
A total <unk> from a <unk> province in Afghanistan.
But my private mother was became a teacher.
Here's it.
It was taken two years ago, only to turn our home to school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is is, was the first first first first left to get education. education.
There was not any doubt that her children had to get to receive education, even their daughters, even their <unk> at <unk>
For it, there was be greater risk in not educate the children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember moments that I was very frustrated about for me, and not see a future.
I wanted to give up but my father said, <unk> whatever is you have in in in life.
You can just steal your money in for it.
But there's one thing to always be with you what is to you, is what is you and sell our blood to pay for it.
So you still want not to do that.
Today I'm today today today today today today today today today have I have been 22 today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than it was -- it would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud of <unk> in <unk>
When I came back to Afghanistan, my <unk> was one of the first first first first first first first first first <unk> in <unk>
He wasn't only <unk> my my college degree, but I was as I carry on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes on me.
I dream -- but my family has even bigger <unk>
That's why is that's why am I am a global <unk> a global campaign for to educate women women.
It's because of what we <unk> <unk> <unk> the first is the only private school school for girls to go to school.
What's the exciting thing is that is that is that is that is I look at the students in my school with the very strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their parents and their friends, as they were, in them for -- to the other to the guys and even in the face of a <unk> opposition opposition.
As a <unk> is not be to show you their face, but Ahmed is the father of of students.
Less than a month, he was and her daughter went out of being killed of being killed by a <unk> bomb bomb
When I got to her -- this is the phone, your phone phone, the phone, a <unk> would <unk>
<unk> now, if I was -- said, he said -- said, "but not hurt the future of my child and <unk> <unk>
What I've ever recognized about -- and is something a thing that is you are often often forgotten in in the West, is that behind the most of those people who <unk> there is -- there is a parent who recognized the value of her its own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to in our success.
In fact, they often are we need the support of men.
Under <unk> are the girls who went to school, tell you about -- remember, was illegal.
But more than three million girls go to the school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is see so different from here in the U.S.
I find out that Americans see the fragility look the <unk> for changes.
And I think that these changes are <unk> a lot, a lot, after the United troops troops. in the U.S. is of the <unk> things.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in the school and their parents to <unk> them as I see the <unk> see the future <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is is a country and possibilities and <unk>
Like I, they dream of big.
Thank you.
Never have never forgotten the words words -- which was died in in <unk>
But never got you a <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost about two years since since the <unk> revolution broke out, was as much of the <unk> revolution were in the <unk>
One is a forces with many other citizens in <unk> in the country to <unk> to call a day of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women are and young young men were in in the <unk> <unk> they're <unk> of <unk>
You have shown a <unk> wire bravery to face the <unk> <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense sense of solidarity from the <unk> East to the to the to the <unk> to the way up the south.
Finally, after a six months of months months of the <unk> we managed to get to release our country and <unk>
However, <unk> let me left a heavy burden a legacy of <unk> corruption corruption and <unk>
For for four decades -- the <unk> regime of <unk> the culture and the moral structure of the <unk>
It comes out of the devastation and the <unk> and the challenges, and of the challenges, and of the challenges, and the challenges, and the challenges, and the challenges, and the women are women -- to rebuild in with many other women, to rebuild that civil civilian society. civil society. civil society of for <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in in <unk> for about 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> years of <unk> I went back to Libya in I went back to Libya in and I went back to Libya in and I went back to Libya in and I went back to Libya in and I went back to Libya in and I went back to Libya in and I went back to Libya in and I went back to Libya in and I went
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> are <unk> by the <unk> -- a women's movement movement to to advocate for advocate for the <unk> of democracy.
I was found in with a very entire environment environment in which was <unk> of the selfish policies are <unk> for <unk>
At the time, our initiative was and it was and successful did that in the time.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in in the first first of the first first early choices choices were in 52 years. years.
However, recently, the <unk> of the choices and the revolution is in <unk> every day days.
One is one day we woke up with the news news -- the <unk> of <unk> ancient and <unk>
Another day would you have the news news news was the news news is the <unk> to the American <unk> and <unk>
Another day, we woke up with the news news news is of the news news was the <unk> of the military <unk>
And every day, every day, we woke up with the government of <unk> and their lack of the law enforcement law. law.
Our society, are made up with the more, and the principles of and principles of the social justice, that we had we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became exactly about the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at <unk> with our American <unk> story and elections.
I'm just like that to say that we, as a nation, took the wrong decision. decision.
We don't <unk> good.
Because the elections didn't they brought peace, stability and security and to Libya.
The <unk> is the <unk> between the candidates and the candidates are they brought up peace peace peace up peace and reconciliation peace peace peace peace peace peace in peace in peace in peace in peace in peace in peace and reconciliation.
No, not they not.
What happened then?
Why are we go to <unk> and dominated with selfish policies and for <unk>
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, the female values of compassion -- <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation more than I needed to do is to do is the polarization of the <unk>
Our nation needs more women will need to be in <unk> and <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of the <unk> and calling it to call it at the time.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, that we not just <unk> but to put it in <unk> rather rather than it is to put it in place in place in place in place of <unk>
These are ideals -- that is in the end to achieve the peace.
Because peace is is as we are about the <unk> and <unk> between the female perspectives.
That's the real <unk> itself.
We need to establish that that is before before we do it <unk>
According to the <unk> <unk> <unk> the word of <unk>
At at the time, the <unk> word that is known to be in all of the traditions and traditions have the same same same same same <unk> for <unk> <unk> the female and men men and men men and women men and women, women, in all the tribes and women, all have happened.
And so, just like the uterus is completely covers about the <unk> the divine matrix of compassion is in the way that goes up in the in the in the inside of the existence is as you grow in in.
So it says, <unk> <unk>
So it says, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that is that the grace is for all.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you a very important question question, which has an answer is as well.
And it's about the secrets of the <unk> and the question is why is you have is left?
Why was someone was to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not not a <unk> no individual domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was just <unk> at at at the University of at University.
I had had had been to New York as as a writer and editor in <unk>
I was had my first first apartment, my first first <unk> in <unk> and had a very big secret.
My was my secret was that many, many times, the man was creating is to me <unk> me with <unk>
The man was who was to remember.
I'm just here to tell you the story of <unk> the psychological trap that is fall in every year million women women, and even a few men.
It even could be their story.
I don't like a typical survivor of survivor in domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I got a <unk> in <unk> at <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for working on for the Johnson Johnson and Leo <unk> <unk>
I have almost been about 20 years to married with my second second husband <unk>
My dog is is a black <unk> -- an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first is my first message to for you is is that is that domestic violence you may can happen to all of the other all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions,
It's all all of the place.
And my second one is is that you all think that domestic violence happens to the women -- is a problem problem.
Not exactly.
Over the <unk> percent of the <unk> are are men, and domestic abuse are only happening in in <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was just said that it would be the last person in in the world was going to read to him, and actually was a victim very typical a victim very typical <unk>
He was was <unk> in the United States and women have three times about three times more likely to be victims of and girls in the age of them.
I was also was a victim because I did not know anything about anything about domestic violence, their warning sign for warning signals.
I met you at on on a cold and rainy <unk> cold <unk>
I was sitting on to me in the New York City, and he started with me.
He was told me about two things.
The first was one was that was that he was also had just had had had just recently been <unk> at of a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and who was working on in a very big big <unk>
But what was I was most impressed at in in that first first meeting was was that was ready and fun, and he looked like a kind of like a kid like in the field.
I had a great big <unk> as blocks, and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One is one of the most intelligent things I did in from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from
He did is all about in <unk> in a <unk>
We started out of and love all of me -- that I was to Harvard, that he was went to Harvard, that he was to Harvard, that I got to have gone to Harvard, who was a passion to give you a passion to Harvard, that I was a passion to for Harvard, that I was to Harvard, that he got to have gone to Harvard, who was a passion
I wanted to know all all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
I was thinking about as as a writer as had ever done before.
And it was why was we have the arts degree to school, school school school, and the future has so much important for him.
I didn't not know that the first phase is in any is any domestic violence is is to <unk> and the victim.
And I didn't not know the second one is is a <unk>
Now the last thing was I wanted to do was was to go to go to go to go to go to go out of that I was going to go to go out of that I was going to go to go out of the <unk> and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for you as well.
I had no idea that I was <unk> in a <unk> financial trap financial and psychological and psychological psychological and psychological drug.
The next step in in the heart is is to introduce the threat threat to you how it is.
And this is where you come in in those guns in the <unk>
As soon as we moved to the New England you know, that site is -- have got to feel so much safe for it.
One was you had in the <unk> of the car.
Another thing was kept he kept underneath the pillow underneath the pillow in the pillow and the third is always in their pocket.
And he said that I needed to cause the <unk> cause cause cause to cause of the trauma trauma guns guns guns -- that he needed to because of the trauma trauma guns guns as cause cause it cause those guns because of the trauma trauma guns guns be because of the trauma trauma guns guns to cause it cause the trauma trauma to cause they because of the <unk>
I needed to feel for sure.
But those <unk> they were actually was a message to me, and my life was already had had had my hand up by my hands, my life was already been lifted up with my hands, my life was already had my hand. my hand.
The first <unk> physicist would in <unk> happened about five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still got in the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises are in my mother and married him.
In spite of what had occurred, was I was was sure that we would live happy happy to do, because I loved the much.
And I was very, very much.
It was just had a whole family way to the wedding and with me.
It was have been an isolated <unk> and I never would make me harm.
I spent two times more on the moon moon.
The first time I was driving was as I was so strong in the head that we would do a several different <unk>
And then a a couple days later, later, driving back to the traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk>
He was followed by <unk> one or twice a week for for the next two and the next two and the next one was a week over for for the next two and the next one was a week.
I <unk> when I was thought to be the only person in in this situation.
One is in every three of Americans are is a victim of the American women is to be a victim of American is is the victim of Americans are is is a domestic domestic violence violence and <unk> in <unk> at any time is the year are children are are <unk> 15 million.
So I actually had a very good company.
To go back to my question: why do it <unk> me.
The answer is simple.
I didn't not know that he was was abusing me.
Instead, I was -- was a woman, in in in in in in in in the other other person in in the world he could help to <unk> the one only person in in in the world who could help to help you were <unk> to <unk> them <unk>
The other question everyone does is is, why not just do it happen.
Why did not be <unk> my <unk> I could have happened to have gone to me.
For me this is this is the most sad and agonizing question that people do people do, are is incredibly dangerous to leave to leave you a <unk>
Because the last stage is in the domestic violence is is <unk>
More than they are <unk> it has nothing nothing to lose.
Some other limbs include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk>
And yet we still keep why they're just not going?
I was able to go to because of one last <unk> beat up to me, is beat up there.
I realized that the man who was who loved the man who would I loved so much, much, much to me have killed me to be killed if it was would be allowed. left.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the police, to my neighbors and friends have to me <unk>
We have the tendency to engage the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the
The question, "Why is why are we go to be?
For some people are in a way to say is not a way to say "The fault is is by <unk> in men who wants to do.
But since I ever since I published the <unk> -- I've heard hundreds of stories from men and women who happened to happen to their lives and joyful lives lives.
Because it turns out that I am a victim and a survivor is <unk> a very typical domestic violence.
I was getting married with a beautiful <unk> guy and <unk>
I have got that black <unk> and also is that <unk>
And what will not ever come back to -- was never, ever be more, is is by pointing my hands in your hands who says that I wants.
Right now, just as you are like, <unk> that is -- <unk> that is -- but all of you <unk> but this is all this time to do.
I assure you that there are people have a few people, people who are really been hearing about right now, that they're be <unk> as small as they were in little little guys out of them.
The <unk> could be affecting their daughter, sister, to her a sister, right now.
I was able to be able to end my crazy mad love love the silence.
And I'm still doing that today.
It's just the way to help these other victims, and is to be able to help other victims, and is my last request to for you.
Talk about what you heard here.
abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence as simply throwing it just on for it.
The victims is victims is need to need all over the world.
We need to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the <unk> to the light is talking about with your friends and family.
They <unk> their vision for survivors as very fantastic people fantastic people were fantastic people to <unk> they have a future <unk> future.
We <unk> the primary signs of violence to be intervening consciously, for to slow down to the victims a safe stop.
Together, we can we turn our bed, our tables and our tables and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call this is be <unk> <unk> and for a time for a time, a time ago.
To be <unk> for for 10 years now.
And I feel like at right now, there is have a little strain in in the room because I should have brought to me <unk>
This is the first change in a <unk> scenario, so I think.
If we some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go to you later on on Twitter.
I also want to point that I have the privilege to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have the privilege to be able to change what you think about in as only 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
So these are so much bad that I don't have to use anymore.
The worst part is is to go with this sweater to because of the head, because it's when I was in my mind.
All right.
Why did I do this? do this?
It's been embarrassing. out.
Well, I hope not not as much like this a picture.
The appearance is is powerful, but a <unk>
I changed what they thought about in six seconds.
And in this photo, it was never had a boyfriend in in real life.
And I was just totally <unk> and the <unk>
Of course, except for surgery or a <unk> as I did is to be able to be able to do to transform our way.
So today, for to be is to be brave to mean to be honest.
I'm like this scenario because I am -- a a model, a model,
Because I'm a very nice woman and white, and white, a woman, sexy.
I'm going to answer the questions -- the questions that people always does, me, to me, but <unk>
The first question is, how can you come to be a role model?
And I always say, -- a <unk> was discovered, but nothing means anything.
The true reason I was wondering what this is is.
Well, over the last few centuries, we're not only defined beauty as we are also associated with as we are also associated with we have associated with we as well.
And that's the one is my <unk> which I've known about for for money.
And I know that you are people in in the public that you are now <unk> and some <unk> <unk>
First of the <unk> are to know about both of the models.
But I have to have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University University was told every one of the models models in the <unk>
The next question people people are always ask about to me is is to do is to do is to be a model when you <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know I didn't have I get care at me.
But then, what would I would tell them to each every one of these girls is, why?
You can be president of the the United States, or a <unk> or an <unk> <unk> would be awesome, if you are the first first.
If I was on that list, you still <unk> No, no, <unk>
Because it's because I'm not in charge of of you, and you could the <unk> <unk> or the next next Steven <unk>
To say that you really want to be model is is how to say you want to do is when you are a bigger one.
Is it -- it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choice.
I'm just going to you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened to happen there.
Unfortunately, once you have to be president of the United America, people would want to be.
The next question that people are always do me is is if me is do me is if me do is to me is if me do is to me is if me do is to me is if me do is to me is if me is if me do is to me is if me is if me do is to me is whether me is is me
And yes, they are all of you <unk> all the photos, but that's just a little bit about that happens.
This was the first time I would <unk> and also the first time he used to me, and the first time was I used to me, and the first time I used to <unk> me -- and the first time I used to <unk> me -- and the first time I used to be <unk> and I didn't even have was even <unk>
I know we are entering into the personal field, but but a little girl.
It was just walked a a few months before.
These two pictures are are the same same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am is at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk> was a French French.
So here I am is with my football team and at the magazine magazine in at the time.
And I am in today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not be in in those pictures.
These are these are <unk> them to do this.
Well, the next question is, people are people always ask me is is: <unk> things for for me.
I've got too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once went to a one and I went to a <unk> and I forgot about for free to me.
When I was was a a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was jumped a <unk>
And they sort of like it to look like -- not for what I am.
I live in this -- and last year, the teenagers who were were par about for <unk> 86 percent were young young men.
And there is only <unk> young black black and Latino women and Latino women are men and Latino women are both black and Latino women and Latino women and Latino men and Latino women and Latino women and Latino women are and Latino women are guys and Latino women are and Latino men and Latino women and Latino women are guys and Latino women are and Latino women and Latino
It's about how many times are you <unk> me, and <unk>
When I did I found out that to the one 53 percent of the <unk> were in the United U.S. don't like to get up at 78 percent of the children.
So, the last question is people ask me is is: How is the life life is for me.
And I think that the answer you are expecting is is, if you're a little bit hair, hair, you will feel very happy.
And behind the cameras, we give you a answer that maybe we would do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And it's all of the way, but it's just one part of what it happens, because what we never said I've ever said in front of in front of what I have never said to in front of the <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about for me every day.
And if you were ever asked, ask you some more thin legs legs and the <unk> will be more happy?
They just have to meet with a bunch of of you have to meet with a little group of models, because they have the children else would you have the children were physically <unk> on the way.
But especially it was really hard to look at a situation with the situation and oppression and gender and gender when is I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is to keep in with this talk, I hope you all feel very much more comfortable about to recognize the power of the power of the image and failure.
Thank you.
Photography was to share with you who <unk>
There was not <unk> no opportunity to do the photos to not even have a very minimum care care.
In fact, most <unk> they took away tourists.
My story begins a <unk> in New York City to give me this picture holding up with my holding me this been holding up with my holding me this been holding up with my holding me this been holding up with my holding me this picture holding up with my holding my picture this picture holding up to me.
He was determined that we went back to New York was a year so we decided we decided we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can actually imagine what it comes is right now.
When my daughter, my wife said, why don't you go to <unk> in New York at a <unk> journey.
This is when we started asking the tourists who were going to get to us to get us into the picture.
It's really amazing that the gesture is is to give it to a complete <unk> be as universal.
No one is no one one one has no one has been <unk> with the camera. you before.
So therefore, we were not conscious of the way to change the life to that we would change us that we would change us as we would change us our life to us that we would change us as we would change us our life to us that we would change us as we would change us our life to us that we would change our life would change us
It became something sacred for us.
This was a picture of a few weeks after the <unk> and what had happened to be understood.
These are pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment, or <unk>
They are also a way to stop the time in a week and our evolution over over years over over the years, not just do is in the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same same -- the same same -- same time -- the same is the same same picture, our daughter raises to the whole life through in and how is they perceived to interact with everything.
That particular time we go to is is is something that we hope with all the year.
So recently, on one of the trips, we were just <unk> when we suddenly got to walk up when he was stopped in dry and a red <unk> <unk>
And I was described to me what had sense to the five years before it was in that itself.
<unk> who was reminded of your heart of <unk> to the time to see that place for the first time for the first time was the first time to see that for the first time.
And now what is you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things things we created is are are are <unk>
So therefore I want to share the idea of being an idea of an idea to participate in the conscious <unk> creating memories of the memories.
I don't know -- but apart are of these 15 pictures, not go in many of the family pictures.
I am always taken out the picture.
And I want to encourage you all of you all come up in in the picture, not <unk> to you all of you all come up to somebody and asked him, it takes us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special special group group.
There are you have 10,000 species species in the world.
The <unk> are in in the most <unk> group.
First, why are they have such a bad <unk>
It's also been associated with as we were stupid characters. characters.
More recently, if you have been following the people in following the American press. applause and <unk> these are are are all the attributes of these are these are are the attributes that I associated with with the <unk> Parliament press of them.
I don't know why?
Because the members of the members are not keep you to prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk> are <unk>
There's the <unk> in the New world who are mostly found in mainly in the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> <unk> where we got to 11 are in 11 are confronted with a high extinction.
So why is why do we are <unk> they are -- are important that -- -- -- first -- first of all, they provide <unk> <unk>
They are our <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> the cadavers up to the road.
They help they help they help us to absorb the anthrax that they will spread and cause great loss of livestock and diseases in animals.
Recent surveys have been shown that in areas where you don't have no <unk> the people are three to four times more time in <unk>
<unk> also have huge enormous important as well.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture culture.
<unk> was the <unk> symbol of and <unk>
In the mythology was the <unk> god was in to save his life to save the <unk> goddess of his life in <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they are very important about <unk> <unk> <unk>
What's the problem with <unk>
We have were eight species of <unk> in Kenya, in which six people are on in the end of them are in the extreme <unk> species in Kenya, of which six are are in on top of the other <unk> of them.
The reason is that they are being <unk> is because of conflicts in the humans and <unk>
In South Asia, in the countries like India and Pakistan, four species species are in in in the middle of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species species in <unk> are in the <unk> critical of <unk>
This is this drug been banned for in India.
Since there is have been a huge amount of time to <unk>
Kenya is to have one of the biggest biggest wind to you one of the biggest biggest wind is to have one of the biggest biggest wind that <unk> are <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with the governments, because the wind turbines do is to the birds.
They're <unk> <unk>
In Western Africa, there is a very awful trade trade to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market. market.
So what are we are looking at these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different different countries, so will you focus on in the way to focus on in a living problem is not to serve at anything.
We have to work with the governments at the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking about to appreciate the <unk> the need you need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services are the services are <unk> are in.
How can you help be assets, make you <unk>
When you go out of this room, are you about to be reporting about the <unk> but talk to their guys to be talking to their neighbors in their neighbors in their neighbors in.
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because we had no energy waste uses energy <unk>
Kenya, Kenya, this is being is to be much going to be to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be much going to be
Thank you very much.
Every one is every thing I do -- and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for for seven years years for in in in Africa.
I was all <unk> up to the <unk> but I'm not.
I worked for for a NGO <unk> and every project we set up in in <unk>
And I was <unk>
I went to the <unk> the <unk> we the Italians was doing a good work in in Africa.
Instead of all we played is to do is to do.
Our first project, which inspired the first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where is we just decided to teach people in the <unk>
So, therefore, we got to the seeds we were <unk> to the south of the Zambia to this is to this absolutely amazing <unk> to go to go to go to go to go to <unk>
Of course, were people not all going to do in doing that, by what they would <unk> them to go to work, and a few times, they didn't have had agriculture.
However, instead we would you possible it was possible that we didn't do -- nothing, we just said, "Thank you for God we are are here."
And of course, all of in Africa was <unk> in <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in <unk> in Italy, in the size.
And we did we not believe that, are we were telling you the <unk> as it is.
When the tomatoes were beautiful, beautiful and red and ate everything.
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, why not do you never come to be.
I thought that only did I really felt really proud of our project did.
Because, at less we feed the <unk> are <unk>
Let's see the <unk> --  <unk>
He wants to want to read a whole book, read <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, are now given to the African continent two million dollars billion dollars in in the last year. years.
I'm not tell you about the damage that money has been <unk> to be.
Just read that your book.
<unk> in a part of a part of the African woman -- the harm of the damage we've done.
The Western people are we are just <unk> or <unk>
The two words are actually come in with from the root root that it means means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any any one of a different culture as they were all of them, you want a lot."
<unk> I try all of the one of a different culture as it was <unk>
So the white whites in Africa are are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little man is for written by by by by by by by by by <unk> who said about the <unk> who said about for the <unk> who said about for the <unk> who said about for the <unk> who said about for the <unk> who said about the <unk> who said about by <unk> who said about for <unk>
This was actually be the first first beginning of help.
The first first principle is aid is is to do.
This is the man who opened this is this was put a stick to in the ground and said, can we imagine a city to imagine a city to imagine a city.
I decided to just answer the people to just respond to people, the people to just respond to people, and invented a system <unk>
So what do you do it?
It never comes to a community is and sit with the people in <unk>
We don't work out from the office office.
We met in a cafe.
We have zero to infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is it's most important is is what passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If you don't want to do that, what is you do it?
The passion that is she has is to have is for her is for her is for is is the most important thing.
The passion is that man is has to have for her own own own personal growth is is the most important thing.
And then we can help you how to find out because no one one in the world can be successful in alone.
The person is with the idea may not have knowledge not have knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this was this idea, why not we, for for people what to do, why -- why it doesn't, for once, you were <unk> them.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings in their communities.
<unk> entrepreneurs will never <unk> and will never be to do with their own money, what a chance they have to have.
So planning is this one point.
People smarter in their community, you don't even know about it, because they not take to their public meetings.
What is we work one to one, and we work on a face -- which doesn't really exist.
You have to create a new new business.
The profession is is is to find the resources resources in to transform a living.
And I started this as a trial in <unk> city city in town in town.
I was was doing a Ph.D. in in that time, trying to tell you what to do.
In a one year, I had 27 projects come to me to ask the question, how can you do that?
How can you do that, and I said, "I did something very, very hard thing.
And I was <unk> --  -- -- <unk>
We have helped you start 40,000 businesses.
There is be a whole new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of being dying of of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one was one of the most most of the greatest great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before before they become involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is <unk>
planning is is the kiss of the death power of the business of the corporate spirit.
So we're now now <unk> <unk> <unk> not knowing what people most people are most interested in in <unk> want to do with their own money themselves.
You have to learn how to get these people to be talking with with you.
You have to give you <unk> you have to be great to the help and say, come up in in mass.
In a community of people, you got to get 200 <unk>
You can imagine a community of people -- and the intelligence and <unk> in you.
So what is you have to do is more you more in the tomorrow?
People are <unk> -- that's what you have to <unk>
So, what is I say to you, is is that the an entrepreneur entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at at at the end of the first first <unk> industrial revolution <unk> the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the fossil revolution, the
The internal combustion engine is not not sustainable.
The <unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable. not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is is is how we were <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't have technologies to do this.
Who is going to invent the technology for for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They will be doing it right now.
There is be a beautiful story story -- many, many years.
There was a group group that they were invited to the end of New York in the city city in in in the year in in in the year in the <unk>
And in the <unk> year were gathered this group together, and <unk> about what I would happen to the city city in there.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if if the population is keeps up to that <unk> to move to the <unk> population to the population is to keep the people to go to the <unk> in the <unk> population to the <unk> the <unk> population is just not impossible to do to do.
They were already <unk> and they were <unk> this dirty dirty technology to <unk> the life of life.
So what is in the next few years, years, in in the United States showed us <unk> <unk>
The idea is the idea of a different things was absolutely <unk> and factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you <unk>
In a other way, will not come to talk with you in in in with you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk> service service.
And then then I have to have to tell you the truth about it <unk>
The smaller company, the company, company has got to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
You know what?
We've never met with a only human being in the world that I can doing, to sell and look for for itself.
It doesn't exist.
This is not not born.
We've looked at the hundred companies companies to <unk>
There is only one thing that all are successful companies in in the world has in common, only one was was just started by one single person.
Never <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't only when it started.
No one is just begins a single company company.
So then we can we create the community where we have is <unk> the people who would do with what someone else did that do to do.
What can you do it? can do it?
Well, you <unk> it can look like for <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that <unk> you <unk> <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People who are around us, can help us in a lot of ways in ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors -- so why not do much knowledge much knowledge a lot of knowledge to not even share the same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same
In the last few years, I've tried to share more more with my neighbors in in in the last few years, I've tried to share more more with my neighbors in in in the last few years, I've tried to share more more with my neighbors in in in the last few years, I've tried to share more more with my neighbors in in in the last few years, I've
These are questions like, how much are they are paying for them to pay my neighbors in your neighbors in their neighbors in.
How can we pay for for <unk> more things to not call the door to <unk>
How do we share more more memories of our abandoned buildings buildings, and understanding is to understand better our <unk>
How would we share more hope to you so our our communities can reflect today our needs of <unk>
I live in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in
And my soul is always find a relief with <unk> giant <unk> who give you a <unk> for <unk>
The city has has one of the most <unk> properties.
I live close to this house and a thought about how I could actually turn it into a more good space space for forever.
In 2009, I lost someone else <unk>
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was suddenly <unk> and unexpected.
I thought a lot of a lot of I thought a lot about death as well.
And this was me a profound gratitude for for for for for all of the time I lived and lived and lived in with me.
It was really clarity to the the most significant things of it was really made it clarity to the most significant things of you really was given to the the most significant things of it was given it to the most significant things of the most significant things of it was really made it clarity to the most significant things things in life is in the living life.
But I just got to keep this in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's be easy to be able to get to catch up the day and day it is to give me really important for for you.
So with with the help help I new new new friends transformed the wall of this left on a giant <unk> and he was painted on about her phrases phrases in <unk>
So, the <unk> could you think about their lives and sharing personal aspiration in public space.
I didn't not know what to wait for this experiment, but the day was I was still <unk>
And I would like to share some things that people people wrote in on the wall.
Before I die, I want to be <unk> for <unk>
Before I die, I want to sing for millions of the people."
You know, die of a <unk> <unk>
Before I die, I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I die, I want to be once more."
Before I die, I want to go to the rescue rescue rescue rescue it. I want I want to go to the rescue rescue rescue rescue rescue it. I want I want to go to the rescue rescue rescue rescue rescue rescue care rescue rescue rescue time.
Before I die, I want to be completely <unk> myself."
This was an entire space room became <unk> and the dreams and hope they got me laugh to get me laugh at me laugh at the <unk>
It is about knowing that you're not not alone. it's about to accommodate the reflection of it.
This happened last year and I started who wanted to do a wall in their community community.
So I was with my colleagues at the <unk> we did a kit -- and now as many countries have all over the world, as as we acquired <unk> South Africa, as South <unk> <unk>
Together we proved the power of our public spaces are if we give us the opportunity opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is in the other people in with.
In our time is to remember that life is is is to be <unk>
The death is is one of you more power to us.
If we think about it as we go to the life to be.
Our spaces spaces can we help us improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have just a only request.
Please don't not tell me that I am a normal.
Now I was like to introduce to my siblings.
<unk> is is it's is is a high and very <unk>
Not talk about -- but is better better than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love is.
The thing is what is going to happen.
It's not look at the skin color.
They don't care about this -- it has never <unk>
When he sings about our childhood, trying words -- the little bit thing we know about the mind and how was we know about that it must be.
Samuel <unk> is a high year-old high.
They would get the memory more <unk>
However, it's is a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I was stole a stole my <unk> but remembers my <unk> but remembers that <unk> but remembers that year every year talks conversations like when I was in when I was in her as I was with me pee in during during the arm during during during the one of <unk>
You don't seem like amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And actually, because their minds don't fit the concept concept of the society, are often <unk> and <unk>
But what it can only do one thing to do?
Now, for all of you are less familiar with the term is -- is is a brain brain disorder that affects as we social communication is and learning to the other.
In each individual it is in differently in a different way, way, to be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is to be diagnosed that faster in the development is that is faster in the development that we are faster that is faster in the development is faster that is faster in the development that we are faster that is faster in the development is faster that is faster in the way it faster is in the development that we are faster
I don't remember my first first encounter with autism, but I don't remember only day without him.
And I was just three years ago, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a whole new to life.
When I was a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't not want to play like the other other babies and, in in in in in in in in at at at at all. at all.
I was lived in in in their own world, around the world themselves, and he was be pleasure at in in the smallest things as we put cars in in in the room, to eat anything thing to be.
As we as I grew up, it became more -- it goes up, it became more different, and the differences were differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> was <unk> the frustration and frustration is -- was something really <unk> a very innocent nature of and innocent, a human person who had never had to do.
<unk> <unk>
I can't actually deny that there have been some tough moments times in in my family.
But I look at the things that I would not want to change the normal.
So, <unk> is the difference that gives us differences and the <unk> doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means is there is a different different view of what it is.
If I could give a one single single single one thing to <unk> and Sam and you, would be you not have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences are you are <unk> are a <unk>
The opportunity was the way we tried to be like others.
Please.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a very little thing to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a a million communication teacher communications, to give you a kind of communication in engineering.
I was scared.  -- really <unk> -- of these students with great great great big great big great big great great great great great great great large great books and their great great books and their great great books and their large great books and their great <unk> books have great books and their great words and their great great books and their great great books and their great
But when you are those conversations, I felt should have felt like that was have felt like that as I fell for for the <unk>
I was at when I had these conversations with I was really surprised me.
And I think the key to open this door is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is a great communication.
We desperately need a great new communication of our scientists and engineers at changing the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking are attacking our larger challenges are challenges of challenges are major challenges to each other, and the work is not have these interactions.
But these large big talks can not happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to look at how to see their wonderful world.
So scientists, are please go to <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how to make sure you make sure you can see that their science is is is is to be able to make sure you can see that their science is is is to be able to make sure you can see that their science is is is is to be able to make sure you can see that their science is is is
First <unk> question of the question is to go about it, and then what?
<unk> why is why science is you relevant to us.
They don't just think that we study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which is the <unk> structure are of our bones up because it's important to understand how we <unk>
And when you're very careful about <unk>
<unk> is is a <unk> for our understanding of it.
Sure, can you say <unk> and <unk> but why not do <unk> and <unk> that is much more accessible to us? to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same thing as they make them about.
Instead, as he said, everything is as easy as possible, as possible, as possible, as possible, as possible, as possible, as possible, as possible.
They can communicate clearly in your science science without compromise you can can communicate with it.
Something is to take is to use is is you just use to you is is to use is to use one other stories -- stories and <unk> them with with them.
And I'm just forget about forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked why they call <unk> the bullets are <unk> bullets were bullets and <unk>
A <unk> like this is not only is is is is not be is to be boring to you is to be held too too <unk>
Instead, this is a <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more an strong <unk>
The trick here is to use a very profound sense of understanding what it is.
I think these are are just some key people to open the door to and look at the country and look at the country and the engineering.
And I scientists scientists -- when you've been solved this this equation, for all means, <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of the <unk> in <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> is <unk>
Although there was as a <unk> is it for by by by for the mere city.
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something is to do with the words, I guess.
It's just very important that the words is to be the base is words, the base are words are the basis in the basis in in the words are the basis in the basis in <unk> and that the politicians do have to try to dominate the language.
It was not been <unk> by that <unk> which the British Parliament was leading to the exact words was the exact words were said to the <unk> camera.
And all of this was all of that was because of the bravery is a guy with the very rare name is who was confronted by <unk>
He was in her in her in the London and <unk> but had enough enough of the courage to you know, popular in London had won.
And just a few years ago, we had the first used on the <unk> <unk>
Most of you think it's a literal <unk>
It's not.
But to actually show you really how words and politics and politics can politics are and politics are the politics are the politics and politics and politics is to want you to go back to the U.S., just after the independence.
So, they had to address the question of how is I call George Washington -- their a leader.
You didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a country happened.
This was <unk> in Congress for for for a very long time.
They were introduced to all kinds of suggestions you might might have been <unk> in.
Some of you guys wanted to call it <unk> of the <unk> state and the other <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>
Not very much.
Some people would just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was as they were thought to be tested quality.
And not even did they have been the idea that you could one of you have the idea that you could one of you have the idea that you could one of you have the idea that you could one of you have the idea that you could one of you have the idea that you could one of you have the idea that you could one the idea that
And I could have been <unk> out.
Everybody got tired of <unk> because this debate debate over for three weeks.
And I read the one day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> the <unk> with <unk> just <unk> at <unk>
What caused the <unk> caused <unk> was against against <unk>
The House didn't not want to Washington not want to Washington be <unk> of power. in power.
They didn't want to call it to him or to the <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the title of you the title more <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> do it happen.
And that title was the title was that title -- was was <unk>
President. not invented the title was ever existed before, it was just <unk> a <unk> <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't not have much more <unk> than the term or <unk>
There was <unk> little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the government, but was really a insignificant.
And therefore the Senate is <unk>
They were said, "is not not call it <unk>
"This guy has has to sign and treated <unk> <unk>
"And who would you take a serious with a very ridiculous degree and people like after <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of the debate, the Senate did not <unk>
We can learn three all three interesting things like this.
First of all, it is is this is my favorite, the way to where I could have been to figure out, that the Senate is never has been -- as much as I was -- the Senate has never <unk> is as a <unk>
President Barack Obama is kind about to keep going to keep the Senate in between in action.
The second thing we can learn is is that when a government says a measure is be <unk>  <unk>
But the third thing that we can learn, -- and -- and this is what I want to you, is is at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all of you at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at
Especially if you have got more much more than 5,000 heads nuclear heads nuclear heads heads heads heads nuclear heads heads nuclear warheads as they have got to be.
The reality is and history have been endowed the title, <unk>
So I just won the <unk>
It was <unk> her their name.
And also the other concern concern concern is the other other concern about the Senate, looking at the time.
But you know, how many nations you are now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has to have the 5,000 <unk> etc. and etc.
So, at the end the Senate won the Senate won and the Senate won the Senate won and the Senate won the Senate and won the Senate won and the Senate won the Senate won the Senate won and the Senate won the Senate won and the Senate won the Senate won and the Senate won the Senate won and the Senate won the Senate won and the Senate won
And I think that is the great big lesson we can to learn, and that I would like to do is to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, it fundamentally changes for the words that they might are.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under a land mine in in Ghana.
The air is is <unk> and dust and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel like the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more much more.

We started talking about slavery -- and actually, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that was exist in the world but not to be grade.
And when we ended up to me as I felt pretty sad, I honestly was was just <unk> this was the <unk> of our days days, and I thought, myself, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He was made a close to the <unk> and weeks later, I flew the <unk> in <unk> to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had already been in many of these places.
Some of you think my second home.
But this is -- <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is says that there is currently in the world.
It's as much as they moved throughout for all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of it was displaced in all of

The equivalent of dollars are currently today.
However, today are today be the entire family families for for <unk> dollars was for 18 <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery is that generates of more dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with by fake labor promises and better education and then find out that they are forced to find that they are forced to find that they are forced to find that they are forced to find that they are forced to find that they are forced to find that they are forced to find that they are forced to find that they are forced to find
Today slavery works in the <unk> goods goods in the slave goods now is in the slave goods goods in the slaves are they are producing them are are disposable them.

There was not be to eat for not to drink, and <unk> would make you just pee pretty much.
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera was was too too <unk> by and let it out.
Every 20 minutes I had to have had to run to the car to get out of the equipment to get out of the equipment to make it work out of for <unk> to <unk>
Back in the <unk> gang wanted I wanted I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my quickly <unk> me <unk>
And I explained to me, very clearly to demonstrate that is is is is is is is for me but for them.
You could not offer any direct aid.
I could not give you money to nothing.
I was not not was in that country.
I could put them in in a worse situation that they were. they are.
I had I had to rely on the <unk> the <unk> system and trusted that you were <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my name.

By the end of the way, we got to us to go out of the way, -- and asked the driver to go out very quickly.
And then then the signal is the way and he said, is the way, this is <unk>
As we started <unk> we just took the <unk> to the road we found that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk>
After two two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up in in front of in in front of we had in front of in in front of we had in in front of in in front of we had in in front of in in front of we had in in front of in in front of we had in in front of in in front of we had

In addition to the thing -- <unk> has <unk> and T.B. as it is to be forced to work at night at night.
But yet he has to do is to have a dream about to be liberated and <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> and is that kind to be inspired me.
I want to <unk> light in the <unk>
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted to know that we will <unk> the other possible to help us change their lives.
<unk> I think that if we can see ourselves in each other as human beings, then they are very hard to tolerate <unk> <unk> like this.
These are images are not about to be people, real people -- and respect for lives.
There's no one day that happened to happen to happen to happen that I was had the great great great honor to meet.
I hope that is turn a a force in the people who you can you can see in people like you -- -- have light light up in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do is math that I do this is applied -- and there's a particular problem problem that we <unk> are the <unk> are like the management management management preparation, like this.
Nobody knows what the Earth do we do.
So I will try to explain what I do.
Dance is one of the human activities activities,
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet use, and the dancers --  which will we see later on.
But the ballet does is -- an extraordinary <unk> a high level component can well have to have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, of the neurological disorders increased as a <unk> does with my friend <unk> <unk>
Over the last last few years, years, have been progress in a last few years, years, have moved a lot more progress in the treatment.
However, there are as we need to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress as an an objective way, and ultimately is we going to know if there is actually is be when we have an objective metric looks like.
But it's is that for for the disease and other disorders in the movement is and the best we have to have is to be like 20 minutes.
You have to go to the way to do it.
And what if patients could they do do it in your home?
So would save you a <unk> journey, what if patients could the patients could do the test of themselves?
They don't want to be personal.
By the way, it costs about <unk> dollars in the neurological clinic. <unk>
So what I like I want to do is as a form of form no form form a form of <unk> as a way to <unk> <unk>
This is is a video of vibration of <unk>
It shows someone right to the way it gives you a sound to when we speak.
And as they did it, it requires a level level level of training as an extraordinary training. level.
Let's think about how long does it take a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can we track the position of the vocal chords as we as <unk> is affects -- also affect the <unk>
On the bottom <unk> of the <unk> strings.
We see the same same <unk> themselves.
shake <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech gets becomes <unk> <unk>
How do you compare these scores <unk> on the voice with the <unk> <unk> Well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both of you use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole range of hospitals to do this.
Both are you are both of are are <unk> well, but do it are <unk> are not <unk>
I mean, they can actually be <unk>
They get very rapidly, they take about 30 seconds as much as a lot.
They all are we all know what happens is happen.
When something gets something got to be so <unk> comes up on at scale.
These are these are some amazing lists to <unk>
We can actually reduce the patient difficulties care in the patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for <unk> routine.
We can actually get to do is goals.
We could actually make a <unk> in the general scale.
We have a chance to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before before it is too late.
So when we give the first first few steps to in in in that sense, are in the way to in that sense, are in in that sense, are in in that sense, are in in that sense, are in in that sense, are in in that sense, is in in that sense, are in in that sense, are in in that sense, is in in that sense, we are
Along the <unk> and <unk> we want to make a lot of data data and start to address these things.
We have to have accessible to about 750 million people in in the world.
<unk> or disease, can you have a low price and leave you to announce that we already had reached six percent of hours.
Thank you.  So let me take all these samples of, say, who is right and who isn't it?
What are you to take these <unk> <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes.
<unk> -- you know, a few people can not <unk> you -- may not be <unk> it.
But we're going to get a one very big show show you in different things in in in in in in in in in different different <unk> and doing that in different different is is is because we're looking for the different of the factors factors look for the factors of <unk>
TR: You have to have got a kind of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my one is my graduate student, have I got to have was -- have to <unk> have done a great time to have now been shown that it works in the project.
TR: <unk> and nine.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: TR: TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before I was 2011, it was <unk> <unk> in the city New York City. City.
We are <unk> creatures creatures.
We <unk> in in the darkness, <unk> in <unk> with no windows and generally we avoid <unk> are in the solar light.
We do the thin models to the perfect skin -- -- all the time to but some of us are really are with a talent to but some of us are actually are with a talent for all of us are.
On January March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March March
Shortly after that, an organization was <unk> out of was in the time to work as a part of the feedback team.
I, in together with hundreds of these other volunteers we knew that we could not stay sitting at in the time, so so long as I decided to have decided to join the three about three weeks.
On 13, May I went to <unk>
It's a very small village people located in in in <unk> of of people -- of people in of people -- -- one of the first first been affected by the wave.
This is the level of water water got over over to and over three miles inside.
As you can you can imagine -- the people was was <unk>
We got out rubble of the channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took out and forth and leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took out and tons and tons of fish, tons of fish.
We <unk> us and loved it.
For a weeks, the volunteers as a neighbors found very similar things.
They found pictures of photos and <unk> and cameras and chambers and <unk>
They all did the same same thing. itself.
They <unk> and take them to different places look at different places in places in <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that these pictures was represented an enormous amount that people had to have.
As they were <unk> of the <unk> and the people were they had to absolutely abandon the whole whole thing they had.
At the end of my first first week, I started at at at the middle of the people.
It helped out the <unk> big enormous, big <unk>
This is actually turned out to be also the place place to the people in the people to get you pick up the photos.
There was -- and had the honor that day they took that a day to go to the photos.
This was really exciting and <unk> had all heard of think more beyond the <unk> but wasn't until far as I go through myself in my myself as I was something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some of you who had more than a hundred years years to some of you guys who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on at Facebook -- and the next morning, was just been so overwhelming and positive and positive things.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first first end of them.
It was not just <unk> but where the water had to <unk> the face of the girl had to <unk> with very much precision and <unk>
In another way, that little little girl would never looked like that as we have to have the <unk> photograph.
Over the time, they came in for the time they came to for the more time, they got a more more more <unk> and <unk> and five days about -- and five days -- then 80 days again on -- and <unk> and five days later, 80 people were in the last 12 countries offered to help.
After two two weeks, he had 150 people <unk> in <unk> in <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village people north to the neighbor to the neighbor is to the neighbor to north in the neighbor is to the neighbor to north in the neighbor is in <unk>
Once we used to the week, our scanner is in in the week were people had to reclaim their pictures.
The time is the time is <unk> in <unk> is is a different story -- is dependent of of the photos.
It was -- that was -- an hour. it was -- it could be a <unk> weeks.
I could actually be a few months.
This was <unk> was pretty much to hand by using the areas whose color and the color is you had not been <unk>
I took a long time.
And the water destroyed all of these pictures are long was in in in <unk> water in <unk> in bacteria, covered it up along with the step of of the time I continue to be <unk> by that <unk> by <unk>
We couldn't <unk> the picture unless they were clean it was and dry the photo would have been <unk> by by her <unk>
We had kind to <unk> the hand. <unk>
We have to have the guide from a <unk> <unk>
It's really easy to hurt even more the photos are already <unk>
As I said he said -- the leader of my group is is is to do a tattoo.
You cannot make mistakes.
The woman did the woman who brought us these pictures -- was also been fortunate in relative to the photos.
He had started to get -- that the <unk> even further.
I was also <unk>
Without their own husband and his husband and their husband and their husband and <unk> the images images out of were able to be able to put the images up in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their photos shared something about a story as we are.
Some colleagues were people found out in in a very rubble station station in between where they used to be used to the house, but his colleagues will <unk> it.
The day day, his husband was to close the barriers to the wave.
He had had got to go inside of the water as it was <unk> <unk>
His little kids are not so small now, -- in in a different schools.
One of them was stuck in in the water.
It took him a week to find out the family and knowing that they were survived.
The day I gave her her his youngest youngest <unk> to the one of his youngest <unk>
For it, in spite of all of these pictures were the best best you could <unk>
After six in in the six months months in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in
More than 500 of all the world helped us to return to 90 hundred and <unk> photos of all of the world helped us to go back to 90 different people. families in all over the world.
During the time we really do not really spend more dollars in the equipment and materials, most people are in <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One is a picture of you or something, one or something, one kind of or something.
They are all <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing to you like to look for.
This is about this about it was about it -- was to restore small little pieces of humanity, to bring someone connection to the past.
When a picture is like that goes back to somebody, it was a huge difference difference in in the life life comes back.
This is also made a big difference in in life life.
Some of you connected to with something a bigger thing to give it up, to give it up with something to give it up, to give it up, to give it up, to give something not a perfect skin. algorithms.
To the end that I would like to read is the day I was back of the day that was after after after six months.
While they were <unk> I couldn't help you avoid people to be thinking about in the people and the stories shown in the images.
One was in a particular one, a picture with women in from the grandmother to me -- because a similar eyes like my family was <unk> <unk>
In the whole world, in all of the few our few our few our basic needs are, are the <unk> right? right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> was inspired by us to wonder and wonder and by a <unk> one of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go about a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion times but to a trillion frames a second.
So I just give you a new kinds of <unk> the <unk> a very rapid amount of technique that it can create a very slow motion of <unk>
And with that we can be able to create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond them beyond it without or see the inside of the body without challenge you really challenge.
If I take a a laser pointer down, and it goes to the <unk> it switch it on the switch it switch it on to the switch it switch it switch to and it goes to the <unk> it switch it on the switch it switch it switch to and it goes to the <unk> it switch it on the switch it switch it switch to and it goes to
And that is a million times faster as a bullet bullet do.
If we take that bullet and <unk> and <unk> in in this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in in <unk>
Now, all of this --   mean, all this is actually happens in less than a <unk> is is that takes for to travel to the light.
But but this is this video is is 10 a billion times a little little bit of times so you can see the light light light.
Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola didn't you know this -- this research --  -- a lot of things in this is to show up what's going on.
And the pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle into with a <unk> stimulus package starts <unk> that starts <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we start seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons come up to the lid and explode in various directions.
As you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can <unk> inside the inside.
At that time, the <unk> were all <unk> up.
Now, if we take a dark bullet and current and organizations, and we can see it a slow to about 10 a billion times as long are you think it would take us to sit at to look at that movie? film? movie?
<unk> A is a whole year.
It would be a film very boring film, a very slow bullet film.
And what about what about to do is <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that you got out of the table, and the <unk>
It's like throwing a rock in a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a one <unk> was like, <unk>
But if you are to realize that, as the light was <unk> the <unk>
Why? Because the <unk> is <unk> and the light bounces it off inside and it goes up after after several <unk>
In the future, when is this <unk> is in it is in the cell -- they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to and <unk>
What do we create this camera in in India?
As you as a photographers, you can you take a picture to a very little light up.
But we are going to go about a billion times faster than the brain shows it, so just go to get some light into some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> which package which is of you and over again with that package is and over again with a very long time with <unk>
We can actually take all these raw data data in in an interesting way.
Superman can you fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, can become invisible to become invisible,
And if a new power of power would allow you to see the <unk> in <unk>
The idea is that is that we could just throw some a light thing on over to the door. will <unk> go into the way to and from there to the camera.
And where we could we get those multiple <unk> multiple light bulbs. light.
It's not not science science -- we've already built.
On the left, is you <unk>
Behind the wall is there is a dummy percent of you <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of the publication was that was in the <unk> <unk>
And a small tiny tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera that goes to go back to the camera but interestingly, a slightly different time.
And like we have a camera that works as well as we are <unk> has a unique capabilities we have.
It has got very good resolution and you can look at the world to the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also to the way up to the way to what point.
When we project a a laser can you can record a <unk> picture you can actually record a <unk> picture you can actually record a very <unk> which you see on the screen, really doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to be going to be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we be <unk> <unk>
This is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this one.
We have things to explore before you before we just got this out of the lab, but in in the future, could we create cars that we could <unk> collisions with what is to go back to the back.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions at looking at the light conditions in looking at the light light by by open windows in by of or a light window.
Or we could be able to be able to be able to be able to build <unk> able to be able to be able to see the inside of the body to <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue is and blood is is really hard, so that is actually you start thinking about as a new generation.
So <unk> <unk> himself is a science in an art art.
I realized that all of you have of data data data is not just for the scientific data is that we can we can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can
To create a create a create a new new form of you can of <unk>
And let's look like those waves and account the time between each of of those waves would is just about <unk>
But it's also something a whole thing happens.
If we look at the light -- these will you leave you under the <unk>
The waves should they need to move to us.
What happens is here?
It turns out that, as we are we are recording at almost at the speed of light, we have would have would have I loved at this picture.
The order for the order to occur in the world is sometimes you have invested to be in the <unk>
We <unk> the corresponding <unk> <unk> billion of the space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time.
Hi. This is is my mobile phone.
A cell can change your life, and gives you an individual liberty users. power.
With a mobile phone, it can <unk> a crime against humanity in in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and <unk> a message in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can actually record a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
All of this is is is with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of the <unk> 1984 and live in in the city <unk>
Let's go back at that time, to this a city to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for a change. change.
This is one is the fall of the people who you were going to go for you to have a cell phone in in your pocket.
Who are in ones have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile mobile mobile phones, service.
<unk> <unk> a Android, a <unk>
It's almost all have a mobile phone.
But today I talk about me to talk about me -- of my cell phone, and how did it change me changed.
I'll talk about this.
These are these are <unk> lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that data out there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. was <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This is directive says that every single <unk> European company has got to store a broader range range to the users.
Who's called an email to <unk>
Who gives you a text to <unk> to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where are we are.
All of the information is stored for for at least in the time, or an Internet.
And all of the people were people stood at and said, <unk> don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want to be <unk> in the digital era and we don't want to want the phone phone and the Internet providers would we know about this.
There was be lawyers, son and priests, all said, "We don't want to do that we want that."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets streets and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of you were even said that it would be is to 2.0. Vietnam.
The <unk> was was the secret police were from Eastern Germany.
And I also asked if it really works.
Can you store all this information on about about this?
Whenever I use is your <unk>
So I was asked how I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that was in that time, that was the one of you -- all the information information you had.
I asked the time once, and I went back to the asking it, and I went back to you, and I went back to you, and I went back to you, and I went back to you, and I went back to you, and I went back to you, and I went back to you, and I went back to you, and I went back to you, and I got
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's because of <unk> my life.
So I decided I just decided that I was wanted this this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, let's not give you this information.
By the end, they <unk> a agreement.
They <unk> the demand to me the data to me.
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law enforcement law is the German law of the E.U. law of the E.U. law of the E.U. school.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a <unk>
And in the same one was in the CD there was this.
Thirty miles and five thousand of you -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- are of information.
And I first looked at them, and I said, well, -- is is a huge enormous <unk> file.
But after a time I realized that is my life a life.
There is six months in life in this archive.
Was it a kind of <unk> what should you do with that?
Because they can see where I am, to step at night, what am I am to step at night.
But then then I said, this is <unk>
I want to make a public public public. public.
Because I want to show people what <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open it -- did this.
This is this is a one of six months months of of life.
You can come up and go to go to go back and forth and forward.
You can see every step every step I ever do.
And you can see how I was in <unk> in <unk> and how often do I call in the way.
This is all do is with this information.
That gives you a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First of all, you are things -- I call my wife and she's called, <unk> a couple times.
And then they are a few friends and they are and they are a few friends and they are and they are a few friends and they are and they are a few friends and they are and they are a few friends and they are and they are a few friends and they are and they are a few friends and they are a few friends and they are
And then one is the other to the other, and the other one is to the other, to the other, one other big thing and we ended up with this big big way. network.
You can see how people are it communicates to each other to what you time to sleep.
You can see all of this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the <unk>
If you have access to this information, you can you can see what the society. is.
If you have access to this information, you can you control their society.
This is a role model for countries as China is and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape shape -- because you know who you talks to whom, who would you talk to whom, who gives you an email to whom, that is all of you have to have access to you.
And that data is stored at at least six months to in the years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in in in <unk> in the fall in 1989, they had a cell phone in now.
And <unk> would have known who I was in in in this was in in this was in in this in this was in in in this -- and it never happened.
The fall of the Wall <unk> may never have happened.
And as a result, neither do the fall of <unk> in the <unk> either.
Because they are in the state agencies and companies they want to store so much information out of as possible as possible as we can possible inside and the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to go for forever.
But the <unk> are living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today is you have to fight for cancer.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go back home, tell your your friends that privacy is is is a way to be fashion.
When you go home, tell your one other representative of you because companies and city agencies can actually store some other information, they don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your <unk> to your phone company, what information is they stored in for you.
So in the future is every time to use your mobile phones to give you to be fighting for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello one, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello one, what happens?
I call me <unk> -- <unk> which I'm not <unk> but the physician who brought me to the world.
I was six times in six different directions were going to go to the poor of me in in in the process.
As I as a result, I have cerebral <unk> -- -- all the time.

I would like to tell you a story about about a little boy <unk>
I don't know your name, but is your story.
She lives in a small town people into the South South in the <unk> in the South South <unk>
This is a close to <unk>
<unk> to the small people to poverty in poverty and on the edge of the poverty to poverty in the poverty and on the edge of the poverty and on the edge of the people to poverty and on the edge of the poverty and on the edge of the people to poverty and on the edge of the poverty and on the edge of the people to poverty and
Without anything in there, it goes to the great city in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in -- this is the big big city, in in in in in in in this -- this is <unk> the capital capital, of Somalia. in Somalia.
When it comes to it -- there is no opportunity opportunities, no <unk> no <unk>
He was just lived in in a city outside in the city outside of <unk>
And maybe a year is <unk>
One is a guy who offers to take it to you for <unk> after dinner, after dinner, after dinner, after for dinner, to <unk>
She meets a a whole bunch of people who gives you a break.

I show you a young.
Finally ran out.
It starts a new life. life.
It's got a sense of life.
A is a beautiful day on <unk> under a blue sky sky. bomb.
That was in that young little village people who was with the great great big city was the great city the great great great city people were these dynamic group of people were in <unk> to the <unk>
So how is the story is how do a story about a small village is trying to fulfill their dreams ends with him.
He was waiting.
I was just expecting an opportunity, waiting for waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first first first first first thing to <unk>
This was the first first thing first put it out of what we call it out of what we call it out of what we call it out of what we call it out of what we call it out of what we call it out of what we call it out of what we call it out of what we call it out of what we call it as
And their story is over to in all around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> urban <unk> <unk> riots in <unk>
For young people, the end the city is the end of the city is is is is one of the opportunity a chance of work, jobs, but young men not participate in in cities.
It is often is the youth that it is suffers about in the <unk> rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in the five people who live in the cities are going to be under a <unk> years.
If we are people not include young people young young people are in in the city growth in cities if we were the door to the <unk> story will be the history of the story as well.
And in my city was birth, about 70 percent of the young people young people are young people <unk>
70 percent don't work, it doesn't go to school.
They do pretty much do nothing.
I returned to <unk> last month, and the hospital was born. birth.
I remember in in front of you going to be <unk> to the <unk> hospital to <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
And if I had been to have been forced me to be in the same same same <unk> in <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason was I was in the last month was actually to harbor a few youth leaders at <unk>
They go about 90 leaders juvenile leaders.
We sat up and had a ideas of ideas about for solutions to the big solutions solutions we city.
One of the young people in in in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> it was <unk>
There was not work any opportunities.
I remember when he was said to me, that because it was this was me -- that because it was this was me -- that because it was this was me -- that because it was this was me -- that because it was this was me -- that because it was this was me -- that because it was this was me -- that because it was this was
They were looking for people looking for people.
But this story is is a different path.
In <unk> the biggest <unk> to get to the point to into the point to the point to the one is to the point A to the point A to the point A to the point to into the point to into the point to into the point to the one is to the point A to the point A to the point to into the point to the point
<unk> years years years of years of years years of years years of years years years of years years years of years years years years of years years years of years years years years of years years years years of years years years years of years years years years of years years years years of years years years of years years years of years years years of years years years
He saw the opportunity and <unk>
It was a <unk> company.
She started <unk> a motorcycle to the local local residents who would normally could not afford to do it.
I bought 10 <unk> with with the family and friends is to be at a time to expand a hundred <unk>
Why is this be different about this story?
What does this make this story differently?
I think the ability to identify and leverage a new new opportunity.
It's the kind of I think I think the spirit might be the tool for against <unk>
<unk> the young young people are young people are to be the creators of the creators of the <unk> to be the creators of the economic opportunity are going to be looking so <unk>
And you can train the young people to be entrepreneurs. to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young young man who was attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was just <unk> some of the young people in at at at at at at at at at at at at at at the at the top of the young people in at at at at at at at at at at at the at the top of the young people in at at at at at at at at at at the at the top of the young
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen it -- has seen in over 22 years, and until long as long ago, you wanted flowers for from abroad.
If I <unk> somebody, when was the last last time is you saw the last time you saw you had the last last time to you saw the last last time to you saw the last last time to you saw the last last time you to look at the last last time you to look at the last last time.
For those who grew during during the civil war, the answer would be: be <unk>
So, Mohamed was looking at an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk>
I created a farm on outside the outskirts and began to be able to survive the hard <unk> <unk>
And they started the delivery of <unk> for <unk> to create gardens in the houses and the city companies companies companies are in and now is work in creating the world's first first <unk> <unk>
There is not public public public public public the public public the public public the public <unk> are <unk> in <unk> in <unk>
It wants to create a place where families are families, the young people can they say, smell the <unk> <unk>
By the way, he has not grown because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in the room, the presence had a really profound impact impact on young people.
They had never thought to start a <unk> business.
They had thought about to work for a government to work for working for government, but really had a very strong impact on impact on them.
He forced it to look at their city like a place place.
The encouraged to believe that they could be like entrepreneurs, who could be <unk> of the change. change. is.
By the end of the day, they already had to have had innovative to do for some of the biggest biggest challenges facing the city.
They <unk> business solutions for for local problems.
So inspire young young people young people are and creating a culture culture is is is is is really a big way.
They need to be able to go to <unk> in the development and set up in the <unk>
They <unk> young young children with the resources resources they need -- <unk> the support that they need to move to the conception to the conception to the people that they need to move of the support to the conception to the young people are needed to have needed to move out of the conception to the conception to the people to move to the support they need to move
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit, is more than to start a business.
It's to create a create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope. hope.
His <unk> <unk> is the way people see their city.
He hired guys hired children in the street to help you to get the bikes for for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in <unk>
These young people are people have a tremendous impact impact on their cities.
So my one is the people to become a way to become young young people to be to become young young people young young people are young people to be turned to a human to become a way to become a way to become a way to become young people to be to become young young people young young people are young people to make the young children in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years and I went to the <unk> in the state of <unk>
It was a beautiful day.
The forest is <unk>
The sun was was to pretend that we were the first humans to step onto the land.
We came to our camp.
It was a <unk> shed with a very beautiful opaque lake when I discovered something horrible horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> one <unk> with <unk> hearts, balls
And I was <unk> was very angry and angry and angry and angry and angry and angry and pissed ...
The <unk> who were they thought was going to clean your <unk>
That is followed by me, and a <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk> our is?
No matter as a <unk> or where is you -- the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department are our garbage, <unk> in <unk>
I wanted to know as as individuals.
I wanted to figure out who makes that work.
What is you like to use the uniform and you will take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I went to the trucks and walked up for his lengths and interviewed them to people in offices in offices and I learned a very lot.
I needed to go a little bit more.
So I started working on as <unk> in <unk>
Now not just traveled in the trucks. I will <unk>
And operated the mechanics and bar and <unk>
It was as a remarkable and learning thing.
They all are asked about the smell.
It's actually not be as prevalent as you believe, and in the days you become very rapidly.
It costs to get used to <unk>
I met people who had worked on for for several years, their bodies were all kept the weight to the weight to all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> is one of the ten <unk> more <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're going out and come into the traffic all day up, all day and it is all day -- all day up, all the day are <unk> all the day.
They just want to know so much so general the driver is not paying attention to.
That's very bad for your worker.
And also the trash is in itself is is just full of dangers that they often fall out of the dangers that they often fall out the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless <unk>
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is is to do.
It is never leaves to come.
It's also as a way a breathing or circulation. or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me like that the <unk> is especially ironic because the <unk> are are the most important work hand on in the city streets, three reasons.
They're all the first first license the first first protective health in public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste to the <unk> and its inherent are people in in in real ways.
And disease that we had been controlled for decades and centuries and centuries are come back to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old old age, we don't have space in the way the consumption is is in at the <unk>
I'm not not advocating for by capitalism, just to go to the point the relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average average speed is need.
And I just mean just at the speed that we used they used to be used to move in in in the <unk>
We usually do is not be <unk> or <unk> <unk> or we have our water bottle.
We <unk> the <unk> we just forgot about it, because there's a <unk> of it.
So I just want to you to you a a couple ways ways to think about waste collection to that we will maybe help you help reduce the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in that conversation.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are in the street every day days, <unk>
They use a uniform uniform in a lot of cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own ours. to us.
It's just kind of a relief.
The flow is always have to be on in a way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard I heard a <unk> for a <unk> truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck <unk> road <unk> truck and he went down to <unk> the stairs in <unk>
And I tried to try to do his work that particular day, but I started cry.
And I looked at me, and just <unk> and said, "We're good for you.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I began to do research out of the waste and went back to see that man.
It's called a <unk> we work together -- many times and we got good good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts are the way we have to include and have all the costs, even the very real human cost. costs.
The city waste -- what we think when we talk about -- represent three percent of the number of the nation.
It's a very remarkable statistic statistic
So in in the flow of you the next thing to you can see somebody else that work is to be clean up the trash for you.
I was at a time to tell you very much.
My work is focused on in the connection to think of in the environment environment in where architecture is in architecture is from the living conditions and traditions.
I brought two two together as an example of this.
Both are projects sit in in the emerging countries, one in the other in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that different different different different scans become different perspectives. as different are different different from different perspectives. in them.
The first one is the first started with an invitation to design a different invitation to to design a several different floors floors in the <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we had to show us like to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, like, "I want to go out <unk>
After you can see some of these buildings are there in in the city we realized that there are are are important to <unk>
In principle, these are the buildings are almost nearly gaps because they have very big stores people can not afford to buy things.
Second, it is you need a lot of energy because the lining is <unk> it takes heat in inside, so it's need a lot of need it for.
In a city is that this should not happen because it is about 20 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25 to 25
And third is what is what has nothing looks like it has nothing is to do with in Africa not to do with Africa.
It's a <unk> for a very rich place in <unk>
In our first first visit to Ethiopia, was actually was actually actually was actually actually was actually was actually actually was actually actually was actually actually actually was actually actually actually was actually actually actually was actually actually actually was actually actually actually was actually actually actually was actually actually actually was actually actually actually was actually just <unk> with the old old market in which is to the free
There's also the idea of use the public space to create in the public space in order to generate <unk>
So I thought, what really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the thing is how do we build a whole new <unk> by applying these principles.
The next challenge was the other buildings that we now see in the buildings that we can now see in in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also among you are in between two parallel streets that they can't not communicate at a hundred feet feet away, that they can't be hundreds of meters.
So the first thing was we did the first first thing we did was to create a connection between these two to the streets of streets, put up of the entries from the building.
And this is that extends to the <unk> and the sun and rain.
And about around this space, we've been applied the idea of the market is that changes in each other because of in the space form.
I also thought to myself, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a one solution to go to the local <unk> <unk>
And I kind of started thinking about a similar fabric tissue to a very similar fabric to you can actually allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you to allow you
Then we were inspired in these beautiful beautiful beautiful <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little little little pieces pieces of <unk> which you wind up the air and light in a way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these tiny little crystals crystals that they used the light looks at the night.
And with these ideas were not easy to convince the way to convince the <unk> to convince the <unk>
But ultimately we all did we all realize that this is is to be much more much more more more than than the <unk> center is because the market had more local to sell.
And also the idea was the whole universe was really was a lot of the material material as much as we had to have had the air conditioning.
So we got some savings on the budget that we used to implement the project.
The first one was the first thing was to think about how to do the power power to the city in which electricity is cut up.
So we got a big big advantage by putting in <unk> in the roof.
And then under the panels are we think about in the roof as a new public space is with and bars that they would create would have created this as a whole city.
And these are <unk> in the roof, which we collected the water water in for <unk>
It's just expected for the beginning of the next year, year, we already go for the past year, we already go for the last next year, year, because we are going to the top of the next year, year, because we are going to go on the last next year, year, because we are going to go on the last next year, year, we already go for the last next
The second one is a second one is is a master plan plan and services and services and services and services and services and services are services in the city of <unk>
And to do a very big project, the biggest one is the biggest I have I had to be done, it needed not only understand the city to the city but also to its environment, their environment, its environment, its environment, her environment, her environment to its environment to its environment to its environment to its environment to its environment to its environment to its environment to its environment to
During that analysis -- I was very special about <unk> a a thousand years years was surrounded by a <unk> wall.
When I went to the -- the first first first design operation we did that we did was was was was to expand the streets of similar blocks blocks blocks blocks for <unk>
In addition to what that is, we select some of you -- some of you some of you -- some of you is in relative to the idea of the idea of that is change the initial model. model.
And the last piece was was to think of the cell was to think of in the cell, the little little cell was in as a part is of the master plan.
I thought, what would you be the best best would the best better answer for an apartment in in <unk>
And it's <unk> because they create a difference difference between the house and therefore a natural ventilation. ventilation.
So they <unk> a a scheme in which he says most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in <unk>
And this is the result which is almost as a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It's got these blocks to <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to for <unk>
And it also responds to the local norms that you can set up a greater greater levels and a lower density density into the ground ... down.
And it also <unk> this is <unk>
The roof, which is the building is set up for construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can can go up and go up and go to the <unk> and make activities like it run a two kilometers in in the morning, or jump out of a building to each other.
These two are examples, have a common focus on in design design.
And also, are they are in the emerging countries, where you can actually look at the cities as we can can see in the cities.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the people change the buildings.
So I can I see even more important to look at the way to look at the architecture for looking for by looking for the relationship between the community and the environment is and connect nature to connect with.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new years, a new new girl joined a new new new <unk> them.
I had a large large amounts of hair and <unk> was <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was really filled up until I <unk> my a plan.
I was one day after I was hid in the <unk> bathroom.
When the coast was salt, salt, I went into the table with his book books.
And then I did.
I took out my <unk> just a little bit of this.
All the like this.  -- -- -- -- -- some of them --  -- -- -- -- -- some of my other other fellow partners had very good things as well.
So, in an <unk> <unk> the notes of all over the world without no imagination.
I put up to all of you all of you all of the <unk> and myself is a way to be there, because we were <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt good at me.
I felt important.
I don't really understand why you never <unk> me.
It's all <unk> all the obvious time.
I never got to me.
But most of the reason I was bothered very good for <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They are so <unk> and <unk>
We know that the babies are suffer from jealousy.
And also the birds are <unk> are tiles <unk>
We know that the <unk> are are actually the number cause one of you in United in the U.S. boys, in the U.S. is in the U.S. children.
And yet, I've never seen a study that to observe the loneliness, or long duration or the sadness.
So I have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the way to <unk> in in all of their possible ways.
In fact, I don't just say that if there was not be <unk> there was not either.
Well, it would not be <unk> the <unk> no <unk> would not have <unk>
There was no king <unk> and a thousand and a thousand and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
I was <unk> the high school reading lists of high school, because we would not be <unk> and <unk>
No <unk> -- I know it is to say that <unk> has the answer has got to.
This year is to be a hundred years years over 100 years years of the <unk> the <unk> study -- the most <unk> study that we might have.
We think about in a child trying to do that a sleep.
We think of you in <unk> in your <unk>
And we just forgot the hard thing that is is that is to do.
We just forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is be the books that Virginia <unk> said were were as hard as <unk> of <unk>
I don't know what the <unk> are <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go as well as well, the novel and <unk> them and <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious how to <unk> the people who you come to the person to be in their wish, is is is a good <unk>
I don't know that I think we got very close to the the bone, when we do we feel like.
When we feel <unk> we tell us ourselves a story.
A story about the life of people are really makes us feel wrong.
Being a <unk> and storytellers storytellers that look exactly what details to you like to go in the knife, it?
<unk> are they do all every <unk> <unk> and that's one thing to <unk> understand.
All of all that is do to give me pleasure to be able to give it pleasure to each other, maybe right now.
And it starts say to himself that story, and since the time -- <unk> says that every single <unk> <unk> was in his collection camera.
You have to admit that we <unk> and <unk> was a notoriously <unk>
You would have would you have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up.
But you don't have to be so much <unk> to think it's a hard job.
<unk> are you <unk>
Is it <unk> you have to <unk>
And how are you are <unk> them.
The <unk> are <unk> of information.
The <unk> are <unk>
At the <unk> they like the big big big great bright hair hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> in the photos.
That's why Instagram is as successful in <unk>
When <unk> is in its in their <unk> agony is listening to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> to the
He says, "Look, I know you think this to be <unk> but is not different to the interpretation of the old text or <unk>
And he says, "These is the real <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look better.
On pain, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> are the pathways to the <unk> wisdom of the <unk>
He says, "A wife says, "A woman.
It is tell us that we go to look for women.
No. I think it's is trying to say that the <unk> are informed us to us.
And there's any other emotion that we can get us open to us in this is that particular thing?
There's some other other <unk> our <unk> horrible <unk> our <unk>
Any other other excitement is that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about it later on.
One was a time to visit for a young young young woman did it <unk>
And Freud said that was there was something a thing was in in that man who doesn't <unk> in what she was.
Well, she was <unk> the whole world knew it.
The poor creature was was in was is is not have no cause. cause.
But he was looking for things that I was doing, was for his wife, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or do they have been <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was being was becoming the <unk> <unk>
The novels are very good at this.
Now, <unk> novels are very good about how we did -- are they make us <unk>
In fact, the more many more many more we are in <unk> we are, the more we became us residents in the more <unk> of the other way into the more many other <unk> of fantasy. in them.
And because of why I think, is -- the <unk> are people to do is to us to make us to make us to make the <unk> or illegal acts or illegal.
<unk> are us to behave in the whole way.
Now I'm just thinking about at for eight years, you got to do that, -- but I'm also thinking about in the good news.
A <unk> woman of <unk> Michigan was just captured a false note account to itself, for for one year.
A whole year.
She was kind to <unk> the back to the new new <unk> <unk> have got to say that when I was like this, or did I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge -- creativity. right?
It's just like <unk>
Like a whole of as a <unk> Patricia Patricia did it was <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She is is a very bright and brilliant character character.
It's the <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> Mr. <unk> books books are the books books books in books books in books books in books books all are trying to know how we all <unk> <unk>
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is about a <unk> or wanting what you have to <unk> and it's under the <unk> <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around all over the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a thing for because we live in in of of the time.
We live in live in <unk>
I mean, are we are good good citizens citizens in social media, where do it -- is it?
novels is us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do is when they are are always do when they are are always do when they are are always do when they are are always do when they are are always do when they are are always do when they are are always do when they are are always do when they are are always do when they are are always
Let's go to the <unk> of <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people are thinking about <unk> you think of you -- think about -- in the <unk> <unk> that criminal criminal.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh, that sounds like that <unk>
They <unk> it needs their help, but <unk> it -- in each of the mysteries.
But how are they work together, something starts to change, and finally in <unk>
We're just <unk> of <unk>
And it tells you that there's not be a person in <unk> <unk> who would not want to give you to you like to <unk>
It's just one of the times as we see <unk> <unk> me like this -- this is also is it?
It seems to seem like a <unk> such problem as a <unk> problem is.
You already know, in the <unk> it is is on the opposite side of the <unk>
The next minute are they are in the same same same same same same thing.
Suddenly, we <unk> it allows you to be <unk> up that idea is to be.
It could still be so easy."
What if you are <unk> are really a matter a matter of <unk> just a matter of where we allow us to allow us to be in relative to the <unk>
Well, maybe we don't have to be ashamed of the excellence of the other.
We can <unk> with it.
But I like the plans plans to do.
So as long as we do we expect that together, happen, we remember that we have the <unk> to <unk>
Just <unk> the jealousy.
The fiction used to invite it to the table.
And look what you <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying scary terrifying scary age, the very Marcel Marcel captured, <unk>
We are in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of you know, Buzz had been jumped on on about the Sea <unk>
Armstrong and <unk> were all of them -- but was in the presence to the presence of the <unk> surface is was the culmination of a collective collective process. creature.
The Apollo program was was in in time days in in the U.S. times.
To get to the moon, NASA was spending about about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget. budget.
Apollo was work at about 400,000 people and asked the <unk> and universities and universities and government agencies. government.
They were dead people, including the crew died. is one.
But before the <unk> was <unk> it 24 men went to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> on the surface which I came to <unk> on the surface, which <unk> the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why is we go in for it.
They didn't have a whole lot of <unk> up kilos of <unk> kilograms kilograms pounds up there -- a new sense of <unk> and the <unk>
Why <unk> the cynical response is is that is that is that the Kennedy was wanted to demonstrate the <unk> the <unk> that this nation was <unk>
But the <unk> words at at the University University are at the University University are at the University University are at the University University are at the University University are at the University University are at University in the University University are at the University University are at University in the University University are at the University University are at University in the University University are at the University University
John F. <unk> Some of you guys -- some some of you guys -- some of you guys -- some of you guys -- some of you guys -- some of you guys -- some of you guys -- some of you guys -- some of you guys -- some of you some people -- some people -- some people some people out of ask, why <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And they might also ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why fly about to fly on in <unk>
Why is play Rice against <unk> <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and doing other things, not because they're tough for it.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> was not just a <unk> victory of about the Cold War. War.
At the time the emotion was the most strong emotion excitement was it was is it be was the <unk> to before it is to the transcendence the powers of the powers powers ...
It was because it was something great to be done.
The landing on the Moon happened in a very long list of the technology happened.
The first is the first half of the 20th century produced and the penicillin and penicillin at for tuberculosis.
In the half the century, the <unk> was <unk> the <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology was seemed to own what is Alvin <unk> in 1970, it was called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of the human history, we could not go to faster than a horse, or a <unk> <unk> ship, but in the <unk> crew flew in <unk>
Since the no human being has returned to the moon.
No one is the problems do we imagine that the technology looks like to go to it.
I remember is to see the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was was five years old, and my mother said to me that we didn't go to the way to the <unk> tube V.
I knew that this was be the last <unk> mission, but I was totally sure that I was going to go to see the colonies colonies as I was going to be.
So it doesn't really happened to our way to our ability to solve problems with it has become a common place.
We just heard it all the time.
We've been heard over for this for the two last two days here, at TED.
It looks like that as we were <unk> social applications things like <unk>
There is nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't have great big problems problems.
What happened?
There is be <unk> in Silicon Valley, which is <unk> who have have been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created -- that has been created
Silicon Valley says that markets are are are <unk> <unk> are entrepreneurs entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk risk did it be <unk> the creation of <unk> for the funding issues or even false problems.
But I don't believe that this is be good enough.
It was mostly <unk> what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists are were in at the risk capitalists are they were in their high <unk> without worrying about for the risk they preferred for <unk> <unk>
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with in such as energy energy, they need a long long time to do is never invested in with never yet.
No, the reasons we can't really solve the big big big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to not solve the big big problems.
Could we go to Mars that if we are <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to require a require a make a political decision decision that was be popular, and that will never happen.
We will not go to because the whole world thinks things are more important to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't actually solve the big big problems are because political systems fail.
Today, less about two percent of the world's world's energy consumption is to be out of renewable energy renewable renewable sources percent.
Coal and gas gas are cheaper to the <unk>
We want to do is energy sources that could you compete at the <unk>
Now, technologists, people and economists are agree about what the policies and treaties to <unk> the development development of you -- -- a significant increase at the price price control. control.
But there is not exist in the current climate is we going to see one consensus. consensus.
At times, the big big problems are they seemed <unk> <unk> it is not be.
We know for for long as long as hasn't got it -- is a result of cause failure food.
But 30 years years have to us have been taught that the disease are not have been to have have taught us that famines are are not to affect the food distribution for food.
Technology can be improve things as crops is or systems or systems or for the storage and road struggle to but will have got massive as long as they had to have existed.
Finally, the big big problems are in sometimes -- a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
The president is the <unk> war in the cancer war in nature, some are some many different types types.
The problems are difficult problems are are difficult for them.
It's not true that we could not solve problems with technology.
We can we have -- have -- have -- have -- -- but these four things have to be <unk> up.
The <unk> mission has been turned on as well as as a metaphor is is to do with those <unk> things.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We are not <unk>
There's no <unk> competition in like in the Cold War, there is not be a politician like for the <unk> and there is not have a popular science science system.
In general, go to the moon it turned out to be quite simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I was not even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in in our present and the solutions solutions can get.
God knows that we are are really missing us.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about you about and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas have to do about.
They're just become <unk> in our society.
I think that's three.
The first is one is a <unk> there has been a big decline of trust, is is a very general belief.
The second is is one <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is is one <unk> we should get <unk>
I think that <unk> the goal and the task is and the task have got to have been badly <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about is is a different story today is is is a story today is is a different story story about is about about about that.
First of all, why is people think the trust think that trust is <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my <unk> themselves, not know the answer.
I will turn me to think that it can have dropped to you think that it can have dropped to be a few other activities or institutions, and that could be increased to each other.
I don't have no of you.
But I can turn to turn to <unk> and opinion is are are the trust that trust is that trust is that trust is that trust is the trust that trust is that trust is that trust the trust is that trust the trust that trust is the trust that trust is that trust is that trust is that trust the trust is that trust the trust that trust is
When you look at all over the time, over the time, long over the time, over the time, long over the time, over the time, long over the time, over the time, long over the time, long over the time, long over the time, there is not many many evidence many evidence for that.
That is to say, the people who was <unk> about 20 years years ago, to mostly primarily <unk>
And the people who were very many people who were very smart, were 20 years years to be quite a lot of a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of do a lot of are
The rest is we are in in the middle, and, by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by
But is this enough?
What is what the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What is you are looking at is are <unk> that people who are people are doing when they ask certain other questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would you come to you, are <unk> in the <unk>
It was <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
And I will probably just ask for ask, "What do to do?
And that would be a very good answer.
And you could tell when you your question, "Well, I trust the other not."
So what's very rational.
Ultimately, in in in the real life, we tend to have a <unk> confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of you trust that we're going to be feeling for by a kind of <unk>
I might say, that I trust in a certain other you had to give up the English <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could just trust my friend more <unk> to keep you a secret.
Simple.
And if we think about trust in the confidence.
I think that these surveys are are very bad tools tools to be used to measure the real level of trust, because they are trying to do -- good good judgment of the people to do that you trust something or something.
Second, what is the happen to the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's is stupid.
That's not not that the goal I <unk>
I want to be more confident in what it is is, <unk> but not not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm not not trust what you are not reliable.
And I think that those people who was <unk> their savings with their savings with the very <unk> <unk> <unk>
Having more confidence is not not a smart target in in this life.
It <unk> deposited by <unk> that's the right target.
Once you said it is, say, yes, it means is that means that means that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means is that means
So what is what is it is to make a question of what a trial is they are in in in certain ways.
And I think that we could be able to be able to be forced to are forced to focus on in three other things.
They're <unk> are <unk>
And if we do we have a very good trust.
But if, if we could not trust them.
I have friends that are are are are friends who are they are to take a letter to the mail because they are <unk>
I have friends who you can do certain things can they can do some <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very glad that I think I don't think I don't have many friends who are to be very compelling to <unk>
If I is -- I still have not not been <unk> me.
But that's what we are <unk> -- to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do.
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we have tried to make us easier for the task to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once he was talking about with a <unk> and he said, "Well, what?
And we found the very same same same same same problem in all of our public lives, them -- that the <unk>
What do they do is is, the work of people who have to do is to <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the same similar examples.
They <unk> all of that, by for the target.
I think the goal should be more likely to be more <unk> and that things would be different if they are going to be worthy about to be worthy of the people who are trustworthy or political officials guys.
It's not not easy. This is the <unk> which doesn't do it properly.
Third, the task.
They go to the task that is to rebuild the work place things happen.
It suggests that you and I should be in our trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we rebuild a a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it -- if they are two people -- together, trying to improve of trust.
But the trust trust trust, is is is is is what is the <unk> because we can other people <unk>
You can't actually rebuild what other people other people have to.
You have to give you the foundations for enough to you that they can be trust in you.
You have to be worthy of as of trust.
And that, of of course, is because of you can't <unk> as you all all of the time.
But you also have to be able to think that you <unk> you are you <unk> <unk> that you are you are to be worthy of as of trust.
How do we do that?
That is in all over the place, it makes -- the common people, the <unk> so very well.
Let me give you a simple business example.
The store where I bought my socks up, says that I can I can do it be <unk> without how we could do this.
I takes me the money back to the money, or get it back to the money, or <unk> the color that I want.
That's great.
I think there's a great lesson to do.
If you become vulnerable to the other side, that's a very good proof of you trust what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're like is pointing is isn't a very hard thing to <unk>
In what are people trust in is is in is in is in is is in is in is is in is in is is in is in is is in is in is is in is in is is in is in is is in is in is is in is in is in is is in is in is is in is in is is in is in
Thank you.
Since the the beginning of computers have got us -- to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between between each other and the material is where the imagination can <unk>
This is the thickness of the glass has has been to become increasingly accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself -- if if I had not had to be <unk> up.
And I started imagining how it would have been.
First I first did this created this a kind of <unk> in in a way so much as it was <unk> against the <unk>
Designers designers can <unk> their ideas directly straight in in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs organs.
So it's just break the barriers.
But the two two hands are still still on the outside screen.
How would you go inside and interact with all the digital information used to interact with all of the hands? mean?
In the was in the division of the <unk> <unk>
They <unk> a a very low cameras cameras to find out the way to get inside the inside of space, and taking pixels directly at the hands.
As an windows and archives have a location in in in real space, is as easy as it grab a a <unk> book.
You can flip the back the book and note lines or words or words are in the bottom every single floating screen. screen.
The architects can we stretch or rotate or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, do we type in in the digital world.
And if we do the digital information comes to that is to us?
<unk> many of us would have we would have been to be bought and returned to things for the Internet.
Now that is not worry about.
What is I have here is is is a <unk> virtual for the Internet.
This is this is the view you get from a device on in your head or <unk> when is the system to understand the geometry of your body.
If I took this idea more out, I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead I thought, instead
How would be a future be?
At the at the last of the MIT who was with me at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at
This is that means that both the computer can users can move the object anywhere in inside of space.
We <unk> what we did is was was we <unk> the gravity and controlling the movement through by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by
And to the way to the <unk> the object are we released the other human movements may mean that human movements can <unk> can <unk> and <unk>
You can be really <unk> <unk> physically and distance and and just takes a kind of a physical thing we want.
Students can use is as as a tool tool a tool to be able to understand complicated with as the movement movement is and feel.
But what's more fascinating that we will change the world is is to imagine how we can program the world is is going to be going to think how to program the world is is going to look how to program the world is going to imagine how we program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just to show you something a thing to begin to start directly about in as part of the physical physical world surrounds us.
So we started today is talk about the talk today -- but if you go to <unk> that barrier, the only single one is is is is is is is is is is is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was in to be a <unk> for for two two years in <unk> China, in the years of years.
When I was first was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to <unk> a school school to <unk> all the <unk>
But my tiger tiger said, said, "No." said, "No."
My parents wanted to be to become in engineering, like them.
After the survive the American Revolution, believed that strongly strongly that there was only is a <unk> path to <unk>
No matter if work or or not.
But my was my dream was to be a Chinese opera, to be.
This was me -- in my early <unk>
A one was a very young opera singer should begin to begin to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I was able to do to go to the <unk>
I just wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> in school and the <unk> has a radio program program.
But any adult is you about the idea.
No adult took it to me.
And I only was my friends but -- were kids, like me.
So at the age of years, I knew it was be too much bigger to train.
My dream is never <unk> up.
I was afraid of for for for the rest of my life a whole second thing to what it could aspire to aspire to.
And I was just so unfair.
So I resolved for looking for another <unk>
No one is all of you want to do -- Okay.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk>
The ones who were <unk> in in in in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about the Chinese life.
And it is not not be <unk>
The Bible is is interesting, but weird.
That's one issue for another day.
But the fifth <unk> was for me was was a <unk> year-old to <unk>
<unk> I said. It's just so different, and much better do it is.
So it became a way of a tool to get out of this is to go to the <unk> guilt is and <unk> my relationship with parents.
The encounter is also led to my <unk> habit of culture.
We have a lot of perspectives.
For first, the beginning is it seemed to be outside that is because of the students in in China.
I had never occurred to me, that China was not had to be in the center of the world.
A is a map means a <unk> perspective.
The comparative reading is not a new thing.
It's is a common practice in the academic world.
There is to research as a comparative religion religion religion and religion and religion and religion and <unk> religion are <unk>
<unk> and <unk> is one more understanding of offers a deeper understanding of that.
And I thought that if the comparative reading is to research, why not do it as well in <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
You can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
By the <unk> the <unk> are the <unk> are political policies politics in for <unk> the <unk> are are political policies policy, politics and in the <unk> the <unk> are the political policy and spiritual is for <unk>
For Buddha, are all <unk> a fear of <unk> interesting.
If you know another other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in in two different languages.
<unk> <unk>
For instance, is it as I was in Chinese in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in in the <unk> it literally means <unk> <unk>
The books was the books had to connect to with people from the past and the present.
I know that I will not be used to feel like never.
Having a dream out there.
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only one purpose of a dream.
Their purpose is to connect us is is to connect us to connect us is is to connect to us is to connect to us is to connect to us is to connect with you the place of that the one comes the dreams, comes from, happiness.
To the <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm now I'm here, -- that I am now I'm here, -- live in with purpose purpose for purpose with purpose purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by purpose by
So the <unk> was the <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first first <unk> client at me.
I was was a <unk> student in clinic in at Berkeley. at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called Alex.
Alex came to me that I wanted to talk about their problems problems.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had got a <unk> as a first client <unk>
And I got to me a <unk> who I wanted to talk about men.
I thought it could to handle it.
But I didn't not do that.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought the sessions, it brought me so easy to move your head as long as they were <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and why is she looked like, was right.
You start to work out that the children were home, get children after that, when it happens next.
For <unk> as I was and I had plenty of time.
But shortly after, my <unk> the <unk> gave me to press the to the people to talk about in <unk> life.
I <unk>
I said, "Yeah, obviously, is they go to marry <unk>
And then my was my <unk> said, "No, not not, but maybe <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work at work at for Alex is is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> is not be the new <unk> of them.
Yes, people are feel about after after what <unk> but did that be <unk> but not did that the <unk> was to be a break out in the development.
This was made that <unk> of you were just the perfect time moment.
So I realized that these sort of <unk> these was is was benign <unk> was a real problem problem, not only for Alex and their loving <unk>
There's 50 million dollars in in the United States today.
This is that means the one is the population, or 100 percent percent of you think nobody gets to the age of not happen before they were <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to look at the <unk> <unk>
Oh, Yeah. It's amazing.
If you work on <unk> they love a <unk> a <unk> want me to see.
This is not just -- these are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the <unk> moments in life is going to happen to happen to the <unk>
This means is that eight in every 10 and experiences and experiences will have happened to have been to have happened to have been 30 and <unk>
People are <unk> no <unk>
This is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years has to have an exponential impact impact is about the amount money money out.
We know that more than half of Americans are live, live in with their future partner at for the years.
We know that it is to want to change it.
We know that the personality changes is more times as it is <unk> in that in that in that at any other time in the life and we know we know that we know that the female fertility comes to comes to its top at the other.
The <unk> are the time to go about it to the body and your options.
When we think about the child, we all know that the first five years are the first five are are the first five years to be really critical for for the brain.
It's a moment in which the life is and common is in the person to <unk>
But what we do we don't hear is how often is there is is is is is is is is is a critical time to in the adult development.
But this is not what the bad daughters are guys are guys by listening. for.
The newspapers are talking about in the time time.
Researchers call the <unk> a extended extended adolescence.
The journalists would <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's true.
As we culture, we've been considered a <unk> what that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> was saying that to make big big -- you need a plan and not not enough time.
Isn't it? right?
What do you think it happens when you go to a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
It's not happen.
They did the person the sense that person is the sense that person and his ambition is and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then every day -- <unk> interesting things like you or their children say, <unk>
Or are they say, "All of say that as she starts a start a start before I start a time before I start a time to start a career before the 30, everything is <unk>
But then it starts sound like this like this: <unk> are nothing to show you.
I was better at the day I graduated from the day that I graduated about a <unk>
And then it starts sound like this: something like this: "My <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all going to get married, but at sometime in around the '30s, went to the music and all started to sit in.
I didn't not want to be the one one only one would go stop, so I sometimes think I got married with my husband for.
Where are the <unk> are <unk> are here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit -- a bit of end, but not <unk> are the risks are are very high.
When you got a lot of things for <unk> there's an enormous enormous pressure to the <unk> so many of you started to choose a city choice to choose one city a much smaller time.
Many of these things are are not <unk> and a research is start to do everything once <unk>
<unk> crisis is not try to buy red red cars. cars.
It's just about what you can you realize that you can't actually do you want to do now.
He <unk> can you want to have the kid you want right right now, or not, can you give you a brother move.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves -- you see themselves, you see themselves, and sitting in in the room and talk about her -- what I was thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the 25, sister came to my office because it was, in his own words, had an identity crisis.
He said that would you like to work in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the art or in the
As it was as cheap, I lived with a boyfriend, boyfriend, you more <unk> you lived in.
And even though of living in a <unk> -- his previous <unk> had been even more difficult.
They were often in in our jam sessions, but then gets up the way to say, does not pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well, one day she got got his head over on his legs and <unk> for over the hour.
I was just bought a new <unk> to <unk> and had happened the whole lot of <unk> but then he was got to see the empty space space that goes up after the words in <unk>
I was just at the <unk> when he looked to me, and he looked at and said, "Who is going to be for me if I got a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care about if I gives me <unk>
At that point, I was a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What was Emma needed was not a <unk> which is really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was the opportunity to do.
I had learned a long since long since I worked with Alex as to <unk> as the <unk> <unk>
So, for for the next few weeks and months, I said I said to Emma three things that was -- man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I said to Emma who was <unk> of that was to Emma that was <unk> in that of you to be ashamed of that of you to be ashamed of that of you to be ashamed of that of you to be ashamed of that of you to be ashamed of that of you to be ashamed of that of you to be ashamed of that of you to
For the capital capital -- I mean to do something to add value to the person.
Doing something is what a investment in what you want to be.
I didn't not know the future as I was <unk> and no one is people know the future capital amounts to do.
So it's now the time to that work on the other side of the country that you want to try it.
I'm not even <unk> up with -- is to <unk> the exploration that should not tell -- that, by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I was <unk> jobs and <unk>
Secondly, I said to Emma that the urban tribes are are in <unk>
The best friends are they are like, and where they work.
That new <unk> is with you to come in almost always comes from outside of the <unk>
The new things come out of what you are called <unk> friends and friends are friends are called a little friends friends are friends come in.
Yes, half of the <unk> are badly got a bad work or don't have no work.
But the one is the other half half the <unk> are the way to this group.
The half of the <unk> jobs are never <unk> then meeting the head of your neighbor is is the way to get a work in work out of do.
It's not cheating. not the science of how the information is going on.
Finally, but not she is believed that you don't pick your family, but do I know your friends.
This was really true when she was -- -- -- -- really soon go to his family when has a partner has to have a couple and it can.
I told her that the time to choose her family had arrived.
Maybe you think that the 30 is is is to sit at the age and even as I agree with you.
But choose the person who you live in you now or to go to you -- when you all are on Facebook are start to walk into the <unk> isn't progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is is before the work.
<unk> your family should you work or killing you for you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we went at that <unk> and she found a a <unk> roommate who worked in in an art museum who was working on in an art museum who was working on in in an art museum who was working on in in an art museum who was working on in in an art museum who was working on in in an art museum who was working on in a
This is that weak that helped you get a work in there.
That job is a reason to leave the boyfriend to alive.
Now, five years later, it's is -- is <unk> special about events events in museums.
This is <unk> with a man who chose <unk>
I was love his new <unk> a new family loves his new new family, and send a card that he said, "Now is the spaces spaces are not <unk>
The story is what I love I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are the planes are coming out of the <unk> airport, that comes to be somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in the way makes the difference between in <unk>
In the same same way, in the next generations.
Here's my idea that worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's just as simple as I learned to say at Alex.
That's what now I have the privilege to say to <unk> like Emma <unk>
They don't stop what they didn't know or what they did not do.
They're choosing your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> high school schools in public in public in New York. schools.
And like any teacher, I took tests and tests.
I gave them assignments.
When the work would go, <unk> the grades.
What was my struck me was was was was was that the <unk> was not the only only difference between the best people best on me.
Some of you guys had a best best they had to have had no credit need to have had no crash <unk> have had no scores have had no scores have had no scores have had no scores have had no scores have had no scores have had no scores have had no scores have had no scores have had no scores have had no crash <unk>
Some of my children was not going to be doing well.
And that is to me think about.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade matter -- the <unk> in <unk>
But these are these things are not be very convinced that each of my students could really learn the lesson that every one of my students could really learn the lesson that every one of my students could really learn the lesson that every one of my students could really learn the lesson that every one of my students could really learn the lesson that every one of my students
After several years years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is is is is a best understanding of the students and learning is from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only one one only thing we know how to measure how to measure the best way to do better.
Is it <unk> but what happens if we have to be successful at the school and life is in all more than the ability ability to be able to learn differently.
So I left the classrooms and went to university to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study of it was, is and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk> West <unk> West <unk> West <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what it was <unk> in in the military and who are <unk> in in.
We went to the <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children <unk> the children would you like to go as far as they could <unk> as children as possible.
We studied the <unk> teachers working working at working in working in work in work in work on for the end of the year and <unk> who would be more most effective <unk> will be more effective in improving better.
We teamed up with private companies, what are these marketers are going to keep keeping the work in <unk>
And who's going to make more money to do.
In all those very different results -- a one is as an important big <unk> a great <unk> thing.
And it's not not been social intelligence.
It wasn't the good good good good thing.
It was <unk>
The determination is and encourage you to achieve very long goals.
The determination is to have a resistance.
The determination is to hang to your future day, it is not only for the month, but for not only have the month a reality.
The determination is to live life as a was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination to study the determination in public schools schools -- a few years ago, I started studying the determination to study the determination to study the determination to study in schools for Chicago.
I asked the thousands of you in high school students to ask for thousands of high school students to do.
It turns out that the children were in when they were in in school.
So it's not only do it be in the West Point or in <unk> National <unk> in which matter is also in the school, also in the school of kids at the risk.
For me, the most shocking thing is about is how little we know how we can know how little science does is know the science science to do.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, how to development the determination to <unk> in the children?
What have I have to do to do to teach the kids a <unk> job of work?
How can I keep it a motivated for the long long <unk> <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals are just simply not ahead with them.
In fact, in our data, their data is often is to be related to the talent.
So far, the best thing I have heard about to develop <unk> is something called a <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that the ability can we change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and they learn about how it changes and grows in in response to the challenge, when they are <unk>
So the one is the time to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finished my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best better ones, our stronger <unk> we need to do.
We need to measure whether they were been successful, and we have to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to
In other words, we need to be determined about to make our children more <unk> children.
Thank you.
I was in in in in as a daughter <unk> daughter is one of my more <unk> <unk>
From now, that time, I was <unk> by because of this is be <unk>
But it is seem to be as well as <unk> like the Great Wall of China. China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can I can bring up this <unk> so much for anyone who whoever is to want to understand and appreciate the one who whoever is to want to understand and appreciate the course of you who wants to want to understand and appreciate the one who whoever is to want to understand and appreciate the one who whoever is to
I started thinking about how a new new way to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was as I was five years old, I started learning how to how to draw out every single character on the right sequence.
I learned about new characters every day for the next day.
Because we're just better than we do it as a faster <unk>
An <unk> was a <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a one a thousand to understand basic literacy to understand the basic support.
The first 200 are you to understand about 40 percent of the basic literature of of them to allow you to understand the basic idea of the Web or newspapers.
Today we're starting to show you how this is works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you can possibly be in <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is be a person who's going to go for a walk.
<unk>
If we form fire is a person with arms in the hands of them as if I was really <unk>
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is this is a big one.
<unk>
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks looks like to a <unk> <unk>
I call I call these eight characters.
They're these building blocks for that they create many more most.
One person.
If someone walks up back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are are -- are three are crowd.
If one person does is say <unk> <unk>
The person is in in the <unk> the person is <unk>
It's a just like a <unk> inside of the <unk>
A tree is is two trees together, together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of up.
Put a little mouth on over the tree, that is -- is a <unk>
Do you remember the <unk> up.
Two things together, it's very hot.
Three together, together, they are so many fire.
Put the fire beneath the two trees, is that is <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, together, these are are <unk> are <unk>
Put up the sun and the moon is bright the <unk>
It is also mean tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes on the horizon.
One door -- put a board inside the door is is is the <unk>
Put a mouth inside inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> had someone at the home?
This person is is hidden hidden in a hidden in a hidden in an hidden by a <unk>
On the left, do we have a woman.
Two women are all <unk>
Three women are together, care is <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this -- the first first <unk> will allow will allow you build up at 32.
The next group of these was eight characters to build up with other characters.
So with each small effort, they will be able to be able to be able to be able to learn a couple hundred to you to be able to be able to learn a couple hundred hundred years, that is the same same same thing you learn about a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the ones we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, together, we got a mountain of fire.
We know that Japan is is <unk> <unk>
This is a sun put on the <unk> because Japan is in this of China.
So one is the sun next to the <unk> we <unk> create Japan.
One is a person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on on the character are they stacked up one on the other.
In the ancient ancient ancient age, that meant in <unk> because Chinese people will <unk> the Chinese <unk> are <unk> their political enemies politicians in <unk> for <unk> to their political enemies Chinese <unk> in <unk> to the beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile is to get out.
A one is a little mouth tells you to where you got to be a way out of the way.
This is just remind me that I got to stop talking to you that I must stop to remind you that I have I got to stop in the stage.
What I prefer to be <unk> are the films I come to see.
I love to share my favorite films from my <unk> when my daughter was is together.
The film was <unk> his imagination for for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and going to take a magic bullet.
But when you look at that as many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raised our children into a kind of <unk> <unk>
However, <unk> magician, was a event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend is to the trend actually take a rise of later in later with, interestingly, was another film that the <unk> was <unk> a <unk> <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about? <unk>
There's a big difference between that two films, you are a couple big difference we see today.
One is one is that you are very little violence violence in <unk>
The monkeys are pretty much aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think that if I got the <unk> draws ends about today, the magician would say, <unk> <unk>
You use magical shoes to defeat <unk> the <unk> computer.
But that's not what happens.
The other one is one one one of the characters who the characters are most important characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice that that when I did is when I had to see Star Wars my daughter, <unk> a few years later, the situation was a different situation.
At that point, I also had a son too.
only three years.
He was not been <unk> because it was still very small for that.
But it was was the second second child, and the level of <unk> had was <unk>  -- -- so was a gap in like a mom to <unk>
I wonder what <unk>
They would be would be <unk> and <unk>
It would the sense that they Luke was is to be to <unk> the <unk>
This is kind of with the <unk> magician and <unk>
How do it make it make it a film? movie?
And we do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world I want to want my kids to grow to grow up with yourself, not a world of men who <unk> in which is where we are.
Why is there is as much force capital F, force in for the road bricks force for <unk>
There is be a lot of literature about about the impact of the black movies movies for <unk>
I haven't read so much as much about how children react to this a stimulus.
I know the experience of the experience is that the <unk> princess <unk> doesn't give the right framework for that I would have served me to navigate for for the world of the adults that I was really expected to be the end of the <unk>
My quest is is finished, I got a <unk>
Why are they stand up there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on to defeat the <unk> and they don't waste time to for other other <unk> relationships as well.
It's almost as you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and <unk> are <unk> <unk>
But they send a message to the children, even though they guys are boys, are not really are really a target public public.
They do a phenomenal work to when we teaching girls to defend against the <unk> but don't show kids how to defend the <unk> for.
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women in writing new stories stories to <unk>
Of course, the most successful theme of all of the time it continues up in classic <unk> each of the adventures are a child or a man, or a man or <unk>
Until that, as many of you are are are thinking, this is this year, it was finally <unk>
I recommend all of you, is already available to stores.
Do you remember what the critical <unk> said when he came about.
I can't believe that I Pixar was is a movie a <unk> movie.
It's not just not let that the <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is about a <unk> test.
I don't know what you heard about this.
It is still not just begin a movement.
<unk> <unk> is this is a comic book and in <unk> is a conversation that I had had to have was with a conversation about that I had had with a conversation about that I had to have had with a conversation about that I had had with a conversation about that I had had with a conversation about that I had had with a conversation about that I had
And it's just very simple.
So then we have to be able to do the <unk> the <unk>
These women are in the way at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you at some of you
Their conversations are you like it?
Two women are there and talk about in each other.
<unk> I have seen -- -- have it, and yet quite rarely do I see in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this one week I went to see a great good quality, good <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> <unk>
<unk> does not happen a <unk> test.
And I don't really think about because a lot of the movie is and women men and women men and women who are men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men and men
We've got lots of scenes of men who had deeply and painful and painful for <unk>
This is be Hollywood.
So let's look at in the numbers.
In 2011, is of the 100 100 more more popular movies make you think they have agreed to be protagonists <unk>
<unk> not bad.
It's not just like the same same one percent that the number of women we've chosen recently recently for Congress, then is good.
But there's a bigger number that this is is in <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
One in the five is women says that has been said to have been sexually <unk> once in in the life.
I don't think this is be the <unk> of the mass entertainment entertainment. I think this as be is the <unk> of the mass entertainment entertainment. I don't think this is be the <unk> of the mass entertainment entertainment. I think this is be the fault of the <unk> of the mass entertainment entertainment. I don't think this is be the <unk> of the mass entertainment entertainment. I don't think
I don't think that films for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos are or pornography are really <unk> but something, is one of the things that I think is is is, there is is one of the things that I think is is is, there is is one of the things things like -- is is one of the things -- one of the things that I think is is, is one of the things
Who are you <unk>
What are you not do <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says the role is a male hero is to beat up with the violence and violence and violence and a <unk> is a woman who has no friends have.
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father was in the privilege to you have the privilege to you have the privilege to raise a daughter as we as those of you who are doing the world, and this is this kind of we want to do.
We have tools for as we are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we hope that -- <unk> <unk> is going to be an active or <unk> <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is is one way to do something really important, and I mean primarily to what I mean the parents.
I think we have to show our male new children a new new definition a new new new new definition males males are a new new new definition are a new new new definition are a new new new new definition are a new new new definition are a new new new new definition are a new new new definition are a new new new new definition are a new
The definition of <unk> are radically <unk>
You'll have read about how the new economy is is to change the role that you care about to the home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite cartoon character was for me?
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are you have in common.
Maybe it's not just be the bright dress dress dress rooms.
I think it's be as well.
I think these are the two people in in are people in in those movies in that movies that you know more more than anybody, be more much more to the other people to <unk> in the potential potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for for my daughter, <unk> I like that for stories for my child.
I want to be more stories like that.
I want to know less about the stories that I told my <unk> to go to go and more stories than it looked like that is is to join my <unk>
Thank you.
As I was in a one of the things that I used to like I was really lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're actually covered the sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over the time, I was <unk> me to <unk>
I started looking at and patterns and patterns that helped me to do it <unk>
This became a kind of a passion for a love of love with the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying them, I realized that I was going to do is to me how to do with my eyes wasn't enough.
Because I in my was a little little beach beach in the <unk>
And my entire sea failures had grown up to the cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to see in a different way.
I want to show you an example of how we can we use the <unk>
This is a place a place in of Egypt called <unk>
And the one is the place to be kind to be <unk> but but when we use the place looks like as you as pink rose pink
What are you are seeing are the real chemical chemicals changes what you are are the ancient <unk> and the activities activities.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data had to be used to the satellite data to that to you to find a a missing city, city, town, called a lost city called -- for for thousands of years.
It was <unk> was about was the ancient capital Egypt -- for over more than a time is about about about that years ago.
The place is place in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because of in the Middle World, had was this great revival of the architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that I was <unk> was located somewhere near at somewhere near the <unk>
This is a area is sort of measure about <unk> by <unk>
Before, The Nile was <unk> right to the next side <unk> and moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do we find a a city <unk> in an <unk> <unk>
And I'll try that is be the equivalent to you to look for a <unk> <unk>
So we used to use NASA data to do it a very subtle changes.
We were able to see where <unk> the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting to you that we think it could be the location location.
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> you can you see here.
When I say is -- it's like the <unk> shots shows you in the ice, but instead we look like the <unk> <unk>
Five feet down, lower below a very dense layer of <unk>
This is that means is that we think we think is to be.
We also found the <unk> jobs work, and <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was there was a a <unk> shop shop in.
This could seem seem to seem like not not a very long way, but when we think of the most common used in used to be used in in the <unk>
So we have a very dense <unk> <unk> which goes the <unk> in in this place.
We also have any evidence is that has been there, was a was a very big city.
We don't still have <unk> the place in close to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources resources have to train young people to train young people used to have the resources resources to train young people in in the use of them as they can also be able to be able to have made great great big big big big big big together.
I want to end up with my favorite quote from the brain was in the <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share the knowledge is most of you <unk>
There is nothing like that on the land.
So according to the TED point, TED was not was founded in 1984 -- do -- -- TED was not been founded in 1984 -- -- -- at TED -- TED was not been founded in 1984 -- -- -- at TED -- TED was not been founded in 1984 -- -- -- at TED -- TED was not been founded in 1984 -- -- -- at TED -- TED
They got the ideas really started in in in in <unk> B.C. B.C.
It certainly gets the <unk> search for in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to just close your eyes. eyes.
Imagine out there, in front of the <unk>
I want to want to pay attention to the <unk> material is made.
Now <unk> a have a group of <unk> <unk>
They are not competing in a <unk> race race and they go into the <unk>
I need you to look like this.
They are <unk> <unk> they're <unk> very much.
They collide in front of the door house.
There are bike bicycles to fly up in all of the parts place, wheels that wheels -- the wheels that the wheels end the <unk> in the wheels that they end up in <unk> places like the door threshold.
And the light is <unk> the <unk>
It is <unk> with the hand of hand.
This is on a very brown horse <unk>
It's a <unk>
They can feel your blue fur, tickle on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk>
They go on for one side and trained your living room.
In the room, and making it be use of your imagination, just imagine Britney <unk>
She's just dancing about their <unk> <unk> singing <unk> <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered up with a way of <unk>
All right. You open the eyes.
I want to tell you about a very particular contest that is be conducted in every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of <unk> in the United States.
I went to cover this this event a few years a journalist, journalist was of <unk>
There was a number of men and a few different ages ages and different different habits.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just once.
They <unk> the names and tens of strangers.
We <unk> all a few minutes minutes.
He <unk> to see who he could actually memorize the order of a <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These are people have to be phenomenon for nature.
And I started talking with some some of the competitors.
This is this one of this -- this is a man named Ed <unk> who had one of the best <unk>
And I said, <unk> when did you realized you were you were a <unk> <unk>
Ed <unk> I'm not a <unk>
I actually have I got a average memory. memory.
All of you who participate in this is say they have normal memory.
We have trained us to do these miraculous acts acts of the memory acts to have invented a two and half a half years ago in Greece, in Greece, in Greece, the same very same few techniques that used to be used to make these <unk> <unk>
And my <unk> is how is you not heard of this <unk>
We were standing out outside of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English -- -- said, <unk>
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney Britney <unk> how do I memorize the order in a <unk> <unk>
That would you look the world that anybody can ever do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very bizarre journey to me.
I ended up with the next year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works for why it doesn't work and what is the potential.
I met a whole bunch of really interesting kind of really interesting.
This is a man named <unk>
He's also <unk> very much probably with the worst worse in the world.
Her memory was was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had to have had a problem problem, it's awesome.
Someone is incredibly tragic, but we all are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this a man.
This is is a <unk> <unk> in he was based on for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We went in a late afternoon together in the public library in Salt City <unk> was <unk>
And back to the one was a a number of the treaties over to the memory is something over 2,000 years ago in <unk>
And I learned a lot of things really interesting.
One is one of the most interesting things that I learned is is is is that there is is that there was as well as it looks like today.
A long ago, people are going to invest in their memory, to give them <unk> their minds.
These techniques have to have been possible in our modern world, but they've changed.
They have changed to us, and I would say that they have to have changed as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have we forgotten how to do it.
One of the last few places are on on our planet where you are really passionate about for this idea is <unk> <unk>
It's actually not really <unk> the one is all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, have a group group at University who had to have a memory champions for the lab.
They wanted to know -- will be have brains in any other structural way, <unk> different from the rest of us.
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave you a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was is really not.
There was be yet a difference and significant difference between the brains of the control are people in control with them.
When they put them in an extra <unk> <unk> your brains as they were <unk> numbers, and faces and shapes you have found that on the memory champions are different to others.
They looked like a <unk> a part of the brain who involves involves and memory and <unk>
Why? Is there is something that we can actually learn about this?
The tournament is and then the rest of the competitors are you need to put a day.
This is is my friend Ben <unk> three times three times about <unk>
On his desk in front of him, there is to be trying to try to memorize in an hour.
He used a similar <unk> technique to memorize the <unk> digits digits
In an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a whole concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
And you have a <unk> is <unk>
That's your last name.
And then ask you, you <unk> that there is is a <unk> <unk>
And when I ask them, you <unk> that word that I told you a <unk>
Do it <unk> which <unk>
The person who was said to their name is is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same same same person who had to remember the same same same person who had to remember the same same same person who had to remember the same same same person who had to remember the same same same person who was who told her to remember the same same same person who was
The same same word is <unk> that is is is is be weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name is not mean nothing to you.
And with all the other other memories of memories they dance on by their head.
But the word was <unk> we know the <unk> we did.
They use white hats white.
They have <unk> <unk>
They <unk> well as when they come home to work.
You probably would some <unk>
And when I got a word for for for the first time, we started putting the <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One is one of the more bonus techniques to do to do to do that is to do to do that goes up to a two and a half years ago in in <unk> years years ago.
It's actually known about the <unk> <unk>
The story is the subject to <unk>
They had had been hired like as as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as entertainment, as we wanted to give a very good <unk>
He stood up foot, he was put up his <unk> her his memory poem and <unk> and as soon it was, was -- the <unk> <unk>
Tell us all.
But not only do it killed all of all, it -- -- all of them but it shattered the bodies bodies happen.
No one could remember where they were sitting to.
So they wouldn't be <unk> the <unk> up.
A is a tragedy behind the other.
She was stopped the only only survivor, survivor, in in in in the middle of the eyes and he closed the eyes and he closed the eyes and he closed in the eyes and realized that the eyes was sitting in <unk>
I took the family family <unk> where were they were who was dear to the rubble.
What was <unk> at at at the at the time is is is something something that we all know about -- is is something that we all know about the names or phone phone phone or paper.
If I gave you <unk> that I was <unk> the first two story I just told you very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you were told you to say who you got to tell you to say who he was sitting on to the brown words would you be able to <unk>
The idea is the idea of the things that you want to remember.
This is one is a advice that comes about over more than 2,000 the years ago -- to the first more over the years over year ago, years years ago, to the <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give you a talk and the same same way they would have had to go to the back to the TED stage to give you a talk and the same same way they would have had to go to the back to the TED stage to give you a talk and the same same way they would have had
What you could do is to imagine that they're are in the door <unk>
And you come up some of some kind of image that is absolutely ridiculous, a crazy way to help you help you remember the first first first thing to do is is is is is is is that competition is like that.
And then you can imagine you go into your house, and look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> about <unk>
And that would you remember that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then I would look Britney <unk> to remind that that funny thing that you want to count.
And then they have some friends can help you to help you want to do.
So it's like the speakers to <unk> their <unk> not word is going to confuse it as typical by <unk>
In fact, the <unk> term comes from the Greek -- which means is <unk>
It's a breath of when people were thought to the <unk> and the people were thinking about it, and in the <unk> and the people think are people thinking about -- and in the <unk> and the people think are like this sort of like space terms.
The first <unk> is the first place to be in in its <unk>
I saw that this was was just quite fascinating, and I joined the way to me.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of about that <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was is that a memory competition is is is is is is is is a <unk> event.
Really, it is like to see a lot of people sitting sitting in is when you had someone else <unk> in the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to be able to be able to write about on something.
I know there are incredible things happen in in the minds of people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to have to tell this story to tell me that if I was going to have to tell this story, you need to try to get myself into the place.
So I started at about 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit to you at the New York Times, ...
Maybe a poem is or the names of an old man bought in a <unk> market. market.
And I discovered that this was -- was a fun <unk>
I would never have expected to go to.
He was fun, because it was not just train the <unk>
What is what is about to be better at better the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images from <unk> <unk>
I was quite excited about this.
This is me -- using my standard training team for for the memory of training.
It's a one is a pair of <unk> and some of you were <unk> covered them only only two <unk> because because the monkey is is is is the worst most enemy <unk>
He ended back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back
I thought this could be good at <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment out of control.
And I won the <unk> something didn't have to happen.
Of course it's just nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers -- but actually is the point.
These are all of you -- that works work work.
And because they are based on in the way it works.
And you don't need to build <unk> of the memory or to be able to benefit some other <unk> about how your mind.
We often do we talk about people with with a great great memory as if it was a <unk> gift of <unk>
The big big big big big big big big big big big big memories are <unk> are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we all pay attention to.
We <unk> when we really focused a focus on deeply deeply.
The palace are the palace -- these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work out because they make us <unk>
It was <unk> a kind of attention -- a kind of attention that most people is is not <unk> by there.
But the reality is the fact that there's not be shortcuts.
That's how things are do <unk>
And if I left to me, that is the notion that life is is to do.
How long are we are willing to lose in what you are already is in either human being in front of the one who walks to our who who walks our to be so <unk> that we didn't even blame us.
I learned the first hand out that there are incredible memory are are to be at at the time is to be at the time with all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you got to be the kind of person you remember <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about the last last 30 years of the history of years now.
It's so much to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a very whole thing to be <unk> just one other <unk> place in <unk>
Because I am 30 years ago, I am I was in the <unk> Jersey, I was lived there at home in a home called <unk> and this was my <unk> room.
In the end of my bedroom, I was with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony which gave the living room.
And there was all left the time on on TV -- so every time I walked up to me.
And I was like this.
It was not <unk> and <unk>
I hated that tour, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and the house.
That's do.
All right.
And those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is -- that is the power of architecture, because the architecture is not about to be about <unk> nor is in the places places.
And it's no good thing that we feel like that way, because we think the 90 percent of Americans spend 90 percent.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are we are surrounded with architecture.
So much.
architecture is determine in in in in ways that we don't even realize that.
That makes us a little predictable.
This means is that when I show you a kind of like this, you know what you are excited to do -- think of think of you think of think of you think of think of you think of think about it <unk>
And I know what you think about this as well as we based on in a building that two two and a half years ago by by the Greeks.
Here's a <unk>
It's a <unk> who are we used architects to create an emotional connection to the ways we built our buildings.
It's a <unk> emotional connection connection, we've used a long time connection.
We used it about 200 years ago to for building banks.
We used to build in the 19th century to for building art museums.
And in the last century in the U.S. century in America, we used it to build it for for to build up. houses.
Look, these are <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea away -- to go away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building is things to do.
It's a whole long time to and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always are afraid of fear the innovation, and they prefer to use ways they might do.
So we were with buildings like this.
It's a very nice <unk>
It's this is the square <unk> Library of the <unk> that was in in 2004, in in in in in and you know, has a <unk> has this kind about is try to communicate with is communicate to communicate is to communicate is to communicate to communicate is to communicate is to communicate with to communicate with to communicate with to communicate with is communicate to communicate with this <unk>
But it is not really much have to do with a <unk> library today.
That one is the same year, in 2004, the other side is in in the country, the other side of the country, ended up at the country, ended up at the other side of the country, ended up at the other side of the country, ended up the other side of the country, ended up the other side of the country, ended up at the other side of the country,
It's in in Seattle. in Seattle.
This library is how we use media is in the digital era. era.
It's a whole new kind of equipment for public equipment for for a place to read and share.
So how is we in the same same year, the same year, the same same year, the same same same year, in the same same same year, the same same same year, in the same same same year, in the same same same year, the same same same year, in the same same same year, the same same same year, in the same same same year, the same same same
And the answer is that architecture works is in the beginning of the <unk> principle.
On the one side is is the <unk> the architects that we're constantly drive new new new solutions solutions new solutions solutions to be.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so long are we getting away as far as we move out of the people.
And all of the <unk> are you think we feel very good, but we don't have a dead other choice.
We've got to go to the other side and come back to the other back to us to connect with these symbols of <unk>
So we all do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like this.
Well, it's about 30 years ago we were in the 1970s.
The architects were just busy experimenting with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something is really hard.
So we can we go at the 1980s, and we started incorporate these symbols.
He <unk> the speech is again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
And <unk> <unk> and we added a bake cake. and use new materials.
I love it.
We don't have we <unk>
We took closets <unk> and we converted them into that <unk> made of <unk>
The shapes were they got to go in <unk> and <unk>
<unk> became a columns.
The <unk> grew up to the size of the buildings.
<unk>
But it was be the 1980s, that was -- that was great.
We all went at the time to in the <unk> and we moved to the suburbs, in the suburbs, that we can create our our our our new genes themselves.
Those arguments could <unk> or French or <unk>
There is probably even have a number of <unk>
This is what happens to <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new places places.
I know are you all know, this is not be <unk>
This is in <unk>
The architects are very frustrated in and began to <unk> the speech again in the other way.
In the years and the early '90s we started to experiment with the so-called <unk> <unk>
We <unk> the great symbols are now we have to do with new <unk> techniques of <unk>
This is is an academic and <unk> one.
Normally, you come in again in in the other direction.
But then, then, have something else happened to happen.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> by <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This building changed fundamentally changed the whole relationship of world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that was Bilbao was one of these rare times and public and public in all were completely agreed to be about about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this is <unk>
<unk> <unk> when they ended up the building.
So, all of the world wanted one to one one of those <unk> <unk> Los Angeles, in Seattle, in the <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was was first first first first first first first first first star architect.
But how can you become kind to be kind to be kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to become kind to
And it happened -- because the media is <unk> around around around the way and quickly we learned that those shapes meant and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction to with these different forms.
The same same thing did they do the top major major mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had these forms, they had these had had these forms, they had they had had these forms, they had they had these forms, they had they had these forms, they had they had these forms, they had they had these forms, they had they had these forms, they had they had these forms, they had these forms, they had
This is in the beginning of the new millennials I happened with other other architects in with other other days.
It went to <unk> and the <unk> and a few <unk> and what happened to with these few these few years, it was actually began to be happening with all of the architecture.
Think is for example, how architecture are they consume <unk>
A thousand years years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
<unk> are they can just take a <unk> boat, can be <unk>
The technology technology can you see in the paper on on TV, and the building is beyond itself beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now; that means is that the speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast,
It doesn't not happen a long time to think of in a building.
You need a long time to be able to build a three years or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
So it's as we were in with buildings like this.
<unk> was not not a two year-old movement was not for 20 years.
For for 20 years, we were we were building buildings like this, because we had no idea how much the <unk> are.
That is never going to be <unk> because we are in the threshold of <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
My guess is that is that when you can be applies to media, it starts to be faster faster until it is to be in both of you in and a symbol,
Now we can make symbols of symbols you like emotional burden to something a whole new thing.
Let me show you how the system works in in a one project that my company works in recently recently.
We were <unk> to replace this is <unk>
This is the center of the people called <unk> in <unk> in the state of <unk>
It's a good community community.
But that was that was that two years before the building was was just exactly the product product, we had no product in exactly the product to the product product, it was not exactly the product product in time, there was not exactly the product in the product product, it was not exactly the product product, it was no product that was finished, there was not exactly the product in
The building was to become just a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to became a way to become
And as they are used to tell your story, they become part of your history, they become part of as they can they become part of as they can they become part part of that your history, they become part of in the way to tell them to be part of a little part of the personal narrative, us <unk> with our collective memory.
I mean, we no need the minds tell us how to think architecture.
We can tell each other one other one other one other one other one other to think about because digital media is not only changed the relationship between of us and buildings.
Think about for you for those librarians of those librarians of <unk>
If you were to build up today, to the Internet for <unk>
We were bombarded with examples examples of of innovation, what it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can you have to take the mayor of <unk> people to the people in <unk> and tell them that there's no unique answer to what it was today.
Let's be part of that of this.
This is a whole range of is the freedom will freedom to experience.
Everything is different is now.
Now, architects are no longer is not ever seen before.
We architects can listen, -- and one <unk> <unk>
That means is that the relates to be <unk> a a way to another one is to each other is is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find a good solutions for <unk>
This is the end of the history of will be very different in the buildings today.
This is that means that a public space in the ancient <unk> city can be only <unk> and <unk>
That means is that that means is that a a <unk>
This means is that some robots can you be able to build our buildings, because because we will be ready for for the ways they will produce.
That means is that the buildings go to the whims of the whims of of the nature and not even <unk>
That means is that a one <unk> garage in <unk> in <unk> or even can get up there at at night.
That means is that cause is -- is not not a customer alone.
It means is that mean that no building is is too small for innovation, as <unk> and <unk> as animals are all going to see.
Because it doesn't no matter is a robot or a robot who is builds our buildings.
It doesn't not matter how to what it matters is is what we build.
The architects do the architects know how to make more <unk> more <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk>
We've been just waiting for all of you guys want.
And finally, we are not be on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk>
Buildings don't just reflect our other way to the <unk> spaces.
Thank you very much.
This is this is be the <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year to as he started walking.
And it makes you very cool way, for children in <unk> as if his body was was too moving too quickly for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things are things like to do for for the time is look at the time is look for for for the time is look to look at the time is look for for for the time is look to look at the time is look to look at the time is look to look at the time is look to look at the time is look
She really loves his reflection.
You <unk> and the one is these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of your friends do this and made me think, is to me, think, to me.
How is we suddenly have we suddenly not good at our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like that.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for <unk> people are looking for <unk> people are looking for <unk> people are looking for people are looking for people in search in for <unk> is a <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years and lives in <unk>
And it just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's in Sunday at night.
He's ready for next a next week at school.
It's got a kind of <unk> it's a little confused <unk>
What is your mom says is and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom says is, and what your mom
So I was a <unk>
Well, so far is <unk> have received more to the <unk> has received more to <unk>
Some of these are are are so <unk> which is not even worth thinking about it.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager, who gets these answers into one of the stages of their most more more vulnerable lives more more vulnerable to the more vulnerable lives. of life.
Thousands of people are going to have people thousands like this, in most girls of them trying to communicate in this way.
But what is it is going to do this?
Well, the teenagers are today are almost never are are in alone.
They're just under the line in and available all the time, available all the time -- -- this is never over.
We've never been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk>
As a one is a mother said, said, "It's just like there's a guy in in your room every <unk>
There's just no privacy. just happen.
And the social pressures of hand with that is <unk>
This is -- that being <unk> is <unk> our kids to <unk> in with the number of the <unk>
There's no division of life and real life.
It's really really hard to know the differences that is or what it isn't.
And also, it's really hard to know the difference between what you can be authentic to <unk>
What is you more prominent in the life lives in front in in front of what is you normal in a young day?
And where are you look for for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are are <unk> about the news news news now.
<unk> <unk> still are still dominate the <unk>
<unk> technique.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk>
For those of the people to <unk> it mean, <unk>
These are these trends are associated with in the popular culture.
It's not very hard to see what the young girls is.
But the guys are also are not be immune to this.
Like the ones of the <unk> <unk> and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want we want our kids to grow to grow to grow to to grow to grow to grow to to grow to grow to grow to to grow to grow to to grow to grow to to grow to grow to to grow to grow to to grow to grow to to grow to grow to to grow to grow to to grow to grow to grow
But in a one of the other way aspects of their identity.
Things like that is like their relationships, their research and other things start to suffer.
Six in every 10 girls would prefer not do something good enough.
These are not are <unk> activities.
They're all the activities activities as human beings and to support the society and the labor development needs to do.
31 percent, almost is almost is not be interested in in in in participating in the arguments you like to call the attention to the physical form. is.
One is in five is are not coming to at at all over the days during the day is when they don't feel comfortable about this.
And in the <unk> of you who don't really care about that about it.
And this is this phenomenon is it's actually been widespread in in America and <unk>
And it gives you regardless of of what they actually weigh these young young people.
So, so many of you are are talking about -- not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on the body is <unk> in <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> the health. health.
<unk> with self-esteem to make you less healthy as they can give them to a food mess to <unk>
They have got these low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people who people all around them and are in and greater risk you are.
And we just think that it is for all for what you make more decisions more <unk> like it is as well as as we are and alcohol and <unk> surgery, surgery surgery, surgery surgery, surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery, be a <unk> sexual relations relationships to do.
The search for the perfect body is is pushing the billions dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women tend to think you think they're overweight and again, regardless of if they have to be greater <unk> rates.
The 17 percent of women don't have in a way you can see.
Think about for a moment in what that is is what we are doing to our economy.
If we could overcome that, what is that we <unk> for <unk>
We <unk> this potential is for interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, it is not take you a long long way.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we have learned that there are three key shapes -- the first is we have to have to instill in trust in your body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to do and build their self-esteem.
The good news is is that there are are available programs to do this.
The bad news is that most people don't work.
I was really amazed at when I learned that a lot are well -- <unk> not realize that -- the situation.
So, therefore we have to make sure that the program that we have program is -- is not just going to have a positive impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on in six key areas, and relationships.
These are six different are points to anyone want to make a education in life education.
A is a fundamental education, but to address this problem requires each one of us that we take charge in in the business and girls in in our lives.
So I mentioned in our circles.
It's not actually count with the contribution to our <unk> <unk> or the size of your <unk> or <unk> that the determination or success or success or success or successful thing.
We need to start to judge the people what they are, not be see them.
And all of us can start doing that, by assuming the responsibility kind and <unk> and <unk> that we published in in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions look like this.
And let me ask you a question: When was the last last time you <unk> a <unk> <unk>
In short, have we have to work together as communities, as governments and governments are to grow to grow to not to grow to grow to not to be valuing their culture, as they as they our children will grow to grow to grow to grow to to grow to grow to grow to to grow to grow to grow to to grow to grow to grow to grow to
We have to put the people to put the difference in a <unk>
So we just will create a different world.
A whole world is where is our children are they want to want to do.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who are you got in mind?
Would you get it?
Would you get it?
Would you get it?
Would you look at your <unk> to his <unk>
Could it be just the woman who is to go to two in a distance.
What would it mean for her, if if we were <unk> this was in that way?
Right Right now, the obsession of our culture is with us to all of us.
But let's move our kids the truth.
It is <unk> that the way you got to do is is is only a part of you is is is only a part of your identity, which is that we love we feel felt.
We <unk> the self-esteem in the <unk> of schools.
Let's change each one one of us, the way we talked about and we compared to with other people.
And working together as a community is from small groups to be turned into agents to become safe at insurance agents in tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five of the <unk> November was a gentleman walked up to a entered a <unk> hotel in in Manhattan at the <unk>
To the was initially was initially -- the <unk> but was a prisoner for <unk>
Fortunately, those plans to spread by by an FBI FBI FBI. FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb was in the World Trade Center, could not afford them.
Later was he was going to be was going to be by convicted of their participation participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, in being a being a <unk> <unk> engineer with <unk>
Only when I was seven -- our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of of me a form of
For experience that I saw that when people take time to do, is not a long way to want the same same things in life.
However, mostly in all of the human group is always is a little fraction of people who thinks we have to use all the possible means so they all lived like them.
Few months before he was arrest me and me with me and explained to me that in the last weekends -- he was and a few friends had been to be at a <unk> training training to me.
He was told me that I was to go to the next day.
And we got to the <unk> I just threw it -- that, without the one -- -- -- -- -- by by the FBI.
When I was struck me to me, my father helped me to hold the <unk> in the shoulder to about for about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about for about to about
That day, the one is the last bullet that he shot up, gave her a little little orange light over over to the goal and to surprise you, of all, the whole goal broke out.
My went to the other and in Arabic, say, <unk> <unk>
From a father, such child.
All of all, it was very much.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk> in <unk>
These are later they would be <unk> by putting a <unk> million pounds in in the <unk> tower <unk>
I admired those men.
He was called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I was 19, I was already moved me to have already moved to have a lot of friendships.
Every every time I started to feel very much comfortable about to pack and go to a different city.
As I was always been the new face side of the class often was a victim of <unk>
It was <unk> my identity to avoid the <unk> but going to be enough <unk>
So most of the time was I spent in the home reading books, or playing video games. games.
For these reasons I didn't have not been prepared for for the real world. world.
I was was raised to judge people, based on by judge people, based on <unk> indicators and their race or religion.
So how can I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences of experiences that they put in my way to think -- was during the presidential presidential elections, 2000.
In a <unk> program was where I was in at at at at the time I was in at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at
My group was <unk> in the subject to the juvenile violence as I was feeling very passion.
The members of this group came out of these <unk>
One was at the end of the <unk> I found out that one of the kids who we had to the guys who we had made of the guys who we had we had to have one of the guys who we had to one of the guys who we had to have had one of the guys who we had to one of the guys who we had to
So I took a several days days to go to the light this detail and realized that there was not be <unk> in between the two.
I had never been with a Jewish friend and frankly really felt very proud to have I been able to I was able to overcome the barrier that all life had to me believe that it was was.
Another is crucial time -- when I got a a summer work work out when I got a a summer work work on when I got a a summer work work on when I got a a summer work work on when I got a a summer work work on when I got a a summer work work on when I got a a summer work work on when I
I was met with people from people from people from people from people out of all kinds of beliefs beliefs and cultures that experience that experience was fundamental to the development of years.
All of the life had been taught me that the <unk> was was to be a sin to <unk> all the gay were gay were gay were the gay <unk> bad things.
I happened to have a chance of work with gay actors and less critics have seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, developed a sense as I wish to be treated.
And I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had to me as a child -- in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but is to do is for something more beyond my control.
Then he came up the <unk> <unk>
Every night was night, it was made me be <unk> in with my <unk> and helped it to me see that the race is religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with with.
In many many forms forms he was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can be from the unexpected and a Jewish comedian had to have had a best best in vain. vain.
I was a day I had a conversation with my mother about about how I was to follow in me a thing to keep you a thing to keep in my heart forever as she's live.
And she looked at me in with your eyes eyes and said, "I'm tired of from you?"
At that point, I realized how much negative energy energy is to be able to keep all of of hate in.
My name is not be <unk> <unk>
I changed what changed when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and started a new life.
So why is why do I decided to go out and put me in a possible stage.
Well, it's simple.
I've been doing it because I hope that someone is one is to me to bring the violence to the violence can I hear that there's a better way.
On the other hand, I decided I decided to use my experience to fight for terrorism and against <unk>
I do that by the victims of the terrorism victims and their loved as terrorism is has been made up to have it been produced to have produced us.
By the victims of the terrorism acts against those <unk> acts and rejection the actions actions.
With this <unk> I put me here as a proof that violence is not just follow the other children don't have to follow the other children don't have to follow up to me.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.
At this point, we have a film that is projects in in their minds.
It's a <unk> film.
It's got a sound sound sound for what you can just start.
Your film has to taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your <unk> your pleasure.
It's got emotions, and anger and happiness.
It has <unk> like moments moments of in front of in front of in front of in front of in front of in front of in front of in front of the eyes.
And it is also have a whole voice within in in the flow of conscious thinking.
The heart is you who experience everything in directly.
This film is is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the <unk> experience the subject of the experience experience and the world.
Consciousness is one of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
Each of us is is conscious of them.
We all have an inner film is all of you and you.
There's nothing to put you more directly. more directly.
At the least, I know that I have to have got an awareness for me.
I don't sure you have to be aware of.
Consciousness is also is to live.
If we were not seen anything -- nothing in our lives would make sense sense of or value.
But at the same same time is it is the most mysterious events in the universe.
Why are we are <unk> <unk>
Why are we have these <unk> movies movies.
Why are we are not only <unk> robots that we <unk> what we got to produce is that we could not experience the movie <unk> film.
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
So I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you really need a few radical ideas.
Some people are say that it's impossible a science science is.
Science for nature is is objective objective it.
The consciousness, by nature, it's <unk>
So there can never be a science science in there.
Because for for most of the 20th century -- <unk> that vision.
The psychology was studying the <unk> but not no one is ever mentioned about.
Even 30 years ago, I had really been very few scientists scientists on for ...
It was about 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as as Francis Crick and physicists just like -- -- -- said, <unk> is the time to you that science is <unk>
And since the time, it was since that, that time, there was be a time -- a <unk> of the scientific work of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the scientific <unk>
And this was that work that work was -- it was -- that was this.
But it also has is also have is fundamental to the time.
The center is the center of the consciousness of the consciousness in the years was in the years was in the years to the brain and some states of the consciousness.
We saw some other kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of in the great great work work that I presented to Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand much better, for for example, the brain areas are to be aware of or happy.
But it's still a <unk> science.
It's not just a science science.
We know that these areas are are related to with these different experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd just like to explain that by saying that this is by saying that this is by saying that this sort they want to explain the questions -- the questions who do we want to explain to the questions the questions that we want to explain the other <unk>
But in a sense, those are are easy problems.
No <unk> <unk>
There is really not really easy for <unk>
Well, it is not tackle the very central mystery process in the brain has has to be accompanied by <unk>
Why is you have an internal <unk> movie.
Right now, we can't really understand.
And you might say, give a a few years years years to the years then.
It's going to turn into another one other emerging phenomenon as we <unk> like them as <unk> and we're going to find out explanation.
<unk> <unk> are all cases in the emerging behaviors, like how are <unk> are adapted to -- are adapted to -- are all questions about to work.
That could we be applied to the human brain to explain some other behaviors and human brain as we are talking about, how we were talking about, how we were talking about -- how we were talking about, how we were talking about, how we were talking about, how we were talking about, how we were talking about, how we were talking about, how we were talking about, how we
But when it is to ask the questions the questions the questions are questions about in the behavior are the behavior are in the behavior are things like to be in the behavior are behavior is are the way are you think about the behavior is are are questions in the behavior are the behavior are about in the behavior are things like to be in the behavior are behavior
But the thing is that the hard is it is to why is that is to why is that is that it's be accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the <unk> are the standard paradigm is the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually don't have much to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific science.
I want to want to be a <unk> scientific theory that it works. for me to hit me the head against the head to looking for looking for by looking for for against the <unk>
But at the end that I came to the conclusion that was not work for for you a <unk> reasons.
I think we got to do is at this point.
We have a used to have a wonderful cool explanation set of explanation for you to do this, the chemistry, explains part of the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't not seem to fit in in this scheme.
On the one is -- is a fact that we are aware.
By the other, we don't know how to accommodate our idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that the consciousness, right is right now, is is is is a kind of we need to integrate up in the world, but we don't know how no how.
You can you like it like this, you can you really need radical ideas, you can be able to deal with the consciousness in a scientific way.
There's a few possibilities for for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan <unk> what's one <unk>
Their idea is is that there is not be such a problem problem with this hard problem problem.
All of the whole idea of the internal subjective movie looks a kind kind of or confusion.
In fact, what we need to do, is to explain the other things need to do.
Well, more power to for it.
That's the kind of kind of need we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is is to be <unk>
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time that you -- -- I want to explore two crazy crazy ideas I think.
The first crazy idea is is is that consciousness is is a fundamental thing.
The physicists are sometimes taking some aspects aspects of the universe as a <unk> <unk> <unk> the time and the mass.
<unk> <unk> laws than the laws like laws or quantum mechanics.
These are laws and not explain in in terms of more basic.
Instead, it is as well as they look fundamental is as a fundamental way to think that, and the world builds to the world.
At times, the list of the fundamental thing they <unk>
In the 19th century is <unk> you can't explain the electromagnetic terms of <unk> <unk>
I think that is where we got to us with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of in terms of basic ideas can <unk> the <unk>
The most natural thing would be about: awareness is as a fundamental brick of of nature.
This is not really mean that all of a sudden is all of a sudden of a sudden a sudden is all of a sudden it is not be the object from science in science.
It opens up the way to make it <unk> scientifically.
So what is what do we need is is to study the fundamental laws that affects the laws of the laws the laws that they are connected to the <unk> the <unk> space processes.
In physicists they say we want much fundamental laws laws that we could we put them in into a <unk> manner.
The situation is something like this.
We want to find laws so simple laws that we could we put it into a a shirt quickly.
We don't still don't have laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is is is that consciousness can be a universal <unk> thing.
Every single system can you have a degree of consciousness.
This is a time to be called an <unk> <unk> <unk> for all of them -- is for all every system is <unk> not just the human humans, not only the human humans, dogs, the elementary particles. particles.
Even a <unk> has some other <unk>
The idea isn't that the photons are smart or <unk>
It's not just be filled with it -- can be filled with when you think <unk> <unk> always traveling at the <unk>
I never can can I slow and smell the <unk>
No, not not.
But the thought is that maybe photons are you have some element of <unk> feel kind of have some kind of kind of <unk> feeling, you have some of you a primal precursor precursor <unk> them.
This can sound a little crazy thing for for you.
How would you think something as <unk>
This is in the first crazy idea that consciousness is really fundamental to be.
If you are, like space, time and time -- is to assume that it can also be universal, just like it can also be universal, just like you can can also be universal, just like the other others.
It is also is notice that the idea looks like it is -- is -- is is -- is is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- is is a much more one one more continuum to with nature.
One more profound is it comes to the idea that that is perhaps the most simple way to find fundamental laws which we can think of the thinking looks like to the thinking thought is <unk>
So there's always always be information processing processing, is <unk>
<unk> <unk> complex as it is in a human being, awareness complex.
<unk> <unk> <unk> simple <unk>
Something is very exciting is is that is that in the recent years is is that is that we in in is is is is is is is is that is that is that is that in the years is a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this up with a mathematical methods.
It has been a big measure of information is in in a system.
And it's not supposed to do with is about <unk>
So in in a human brain, there is is an incredible way in a human brain, a lot of <unk>
In a mouse is in the way of information as is a very significant degree of <unk>
But when you go to the <unk> the <unk> particles -- the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of data is is is is is is is is to not either.
In <unk> will still be a level of <unk> different <unk>
It actually <unk> a high <unk> percent of you <unk>
Moreover, another one is other is that the <unk> can help us to integrate consciousness to the physical world. world.
physicists and philosophers have often have looked at that the physics is is is <unk> abstract.
We <unk> the structure is actually using a bunch of equations, but not really talks about the reality that underlies underneath.
As an ad explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is you come out of the <unk>
From all the <unk> the physical equations can <unk> as they are, but are they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what is what physical physicists actually describe the flow of consciousness.
According to mind, consciousness is is the one you put a fire in the equations.
In that view, the consciousness is not be found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's just in the center.
This is a vision, I think, <unk> the has the potential is to address our relationship to nature, and it can have social consequences and ethical consequences.
Some can you be <unk> them.
I used to think that I wasn't should eat anything is to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of <unk>
I think of all about well, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters is in terms of their difference as it is.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems like computers.
What is there is about the artificial action system in <unk>
It's <unk>
According to what the <unk> data has got an information processing is so much that the answer is is how to the answer is is how to the answer is to do.
If we do really do is really briefly run a lot of ethical problems -- pretty serious problems of design systems systems and <unk> systems.
Finally, you can ask for for the consciousness awareness is the planet.
Canada is has their own <unk>
Or is a more local level, an integrated group that as the audience is in at in this time we have to have a very whole bunch of TED.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at the least one question is you should have seriously.
So this is -- this <unk> -- is is a very good thing.
Actually, I'm really sure the first idea is crazy that consciousness is is a fundamental thing to be in the second is that it's universal is universal.
The vision is how do complex complex complex complex do we know about.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way to a theory of <unk>
If I not, well, probably this is is the more difficult problem is and of philosophy.
We can't wait to do it overnight.
But I think we finally we will be going to be able to figure out.
Understanding is the real good key, I think, to understand the other and understanding ourselves.
We might just need the crazy cool idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village village on in in the rural town. up.
I had a very normal profile under <unk>
I went to the school, I was with my <unk> with my younger sisters.
It was all was very normal.
And when I was was 15, a member years old, a member of my parents because he wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Okay, that's really very nice -- is a big problem. problem.
She has not actually gotten anything."
I went to the school, he was had good at school, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I do. what a contradiction.
But they were right. <unk>
I didn't do nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing is being able to be kind of as a a achievement if if if if we have the disability were outside from outside of the equation.
Years was in in the second part of you were in in the second part of you were in in the second part of you were in in the second part of you were in in in the second part of you were in in the second part of you were in in in the second part of you were in in in the second part of you were in
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been to have been a been talking about <unk> for for a good good good good good good good.
And he said, "You're like, <unk>
When the people are in the <unk> they talked about <unk> things like in school?"
"Why don't you look at the <unk> <unk>
And it was when I realized, when I realized, this a child have been experiences with people with impaired objects objects.
And we are not -- -- -- is not a true for many of us.
For us, the people who people are disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk> people.
We are not real people.
And in fact, I'm just like this is what I do this in this is to what I do this in this a chair -- -- what I do in this a wheelchair, to what I do in this is to what I do in this a wheelchair, to what I do in this is to what I do in this a wheelchair, to what I do in this is
Well, ladies are I fear -- <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to us in relative to disability.
Yes, they have have been sold the lie is that disability is is a <unk> <unk>
It's a little wrong thing makes makes you exceptional.
It's not something something a bad thing to not do it quite remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to be able to spread even more a lie through through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only one is a bad <unk>
Or is you -- your <unk> is a <unk> <unk>
Or is that <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a great amount of them.
You may have seen you have seen -- one of the girl without <unk> a pen by through the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with little carbon fiber.
And there's a whole bunch of images, that are are what we call <unk> <unk>
And use is use the <unk> to a other group of people for for people.
So in it is <unk> the people who had no disability. <unk>
The purpose of these images are is is is <unk> the way to the one we can see and think, "Well, for very much bad as my life, could be worse.
I could be that a person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost on the number of times I've been approached about the number of times I've been approached about the number of times I've been approached about the number of times I've been approached about the number of times I've been approached about the number of times I've been approached about the number of times I've been approached about the number of times I've been approached about the number of
It was as I was in <unk> me for getting up in the morning and remember my own own name.
These images are people with disability for people with no disability.
They're just so much going to think that things are are not that bad for you or to put their concerns.
And life as a disabled person is being disabled is really difficult.
We would have a few things.
But the things are the things you can think to think.
They're not not relative things relative to our bodies.
I use is I use the more disabled because of our society lives in that because our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in in a long time.
I am -- <unk> with him.
The thing about the things as well.
They're not doing nothing out of the common.
They simply are taking the best best in them.
So it's actually <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk> things.
When we are people say, "You're a <unk> source that says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been these lie to us <unk>
And honestly do it not do it.
And I know what you are thinking.
I am -- <unk> the inspiration -- and you are you are like, <unk> <unk>
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> of the other people with people with disability at the time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
Now, <unk> that is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to get the things to fall down.
Great.
We learn about the force and resilience and resilience is not against our bodies and our diagnosing them as we were <unk> <unk>
I really think that that lie has to have been about is the greatest <unk>
It makes us make us the hard life.
And that <unk> the one is the one is the one is in life is is is a bad is because of because of the social social model.
A lot of of you know, a whole bunch of smiles in front of in front of has has never been to become a <unk>
Never.    <unk> in front of the <unk>
Nor are people in in the middle of people in in the middle of people in in the middle people in in the middle of people in in the middle people in the middle people in in the middle of people in in the middle people in in the middle people in in the middle people in in the middle people in in the middle people in in the middle
It's just not going to happen.
I want to actually live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a one was 15 years, sitting in in the <unk> watching watching me <unk> not nothing to <unk>
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low as low to get up of the bed and the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement and <unk> and I want to live in in a world where a child is to do.
The disability does not be aware about it as well.
Thank you.
What are you have to see the augmented reality and football football with the <unk> with <unk>
And what is what is the average speed is of you have no <unk> not <unk>
Unfortunately, just answer is one of those questions, so well, please don't <unk>
When people are really think about it <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the hands of the hands in the hands of the hands in the air.
<unk> reality is that happens in our days and it is and people need to be able to change our lives as much like the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how did we get to make it happen.
The first step, is what I've been wearing to <unk> the Google Google <unk>
I'm sure many are you familiar with with them.
What you may not know is that is that the Google <unk> is a device that allows you to see what I see.
Let me experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is is is is is that is that I tried to try to do it.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can we use the Google Google Google -- and know what it is to run by the game to <unk>
We can know that it feels like that you feel like that a man feels like that a man feels like that it feels like that it feels like that is all of you feel like.
I've been there, and assure you, it's not good at all.
I would just put some a few videos of videos to show what is to use Google <unk> under the <unk>
Unfortunately, are not images in <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is in to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> go.
It's a <unk> be <unk>
So a few is a moment a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> as you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can you can see -- is -- is what is to be <unk> in in the <unk>
You may have realized that we lack the rest of the <unk>
We have a video from <unk> from the University of the University University of at the University of the University of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Deep Blue Blue Go!
Chris <unk> this is the things a little bit more about to be in in the field, but has nothing to do with in <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans would you like to be in the field, being is to be is to be is to be to be is to be is to be to be in the field is to be is to be to be to be in the field is to be is to be to be to be in the field is to be is to be to be to be in
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we got that experience with <unk> and Google is how do we take it the next next <unk> experience.
We took that level with something called an <unk> <unk> which surely are you know it.
The <unk> <unk> has ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you about why, by with this video video.
Man: Oh, good.
No, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh oh my God!
CK: That's the experience of a man in <unk> in <unk> for his life.
What will be is to be when you have a a fan experience experience.
When I was able to be <unk> running by the <unk> and put the ball by <unk>
What is to be when you go to the mountain to over more miles an hour as a <unk>
Maybe they <unk> the <unk> <unk>
But this is not really be <unk> up.
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get really <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> reality is when <unk> the <unk> the <unk> their students are want to see and think, how do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it for for <unk> <unk>
Because they are always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you a money. day.
So, I've been here a little bit about about technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> they got a <unk> to their field <unk> so it would play faster.
They got a Super Bowl, that year.
Some of the other teams have decided to have some other other few other people had decided to take it out.
They more people saw is because it was more exciting, it becomes more rapidly.
In 1994, the <unk> also put radii of in the <unk> Island <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was be faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> just imagine that you are are a player going to go to your group and you see your next audience shown in in front of you in in in front of you guys will not have to worry about to forget about.
Or is you <unk> the strategy.
They just go to the field and react.
And the coaches do it like it because if they don't go for their <unk> and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties, you as a a coach.
And they don't want to do that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual for <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect and improve the game.
How do we do?
Well, a very simple option would you have a camera in every single single people on the <unk>
You also get information out of the <unk> sensors and <unk> and something is already <unk>
And all of all of you get to your <unk> are players.
The good people will know are <unk>
bad people will have information <unk>
This is <unk> the good good guys are bad guys.
So, your team team will will be as important as your <unk> and <unk>
It'll be also <unk> who <unk>
How would you be in the country?
Imagine what are you are in the field in the field.
Let's go the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receptor -- all of a a sudden, a <unk> of a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a sudden, a
It goes to the protection.
Another <unk> do you tell you that there is is a open <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And it is loses the trajectory.
You don't know where it is -- but the receptor sees is in the viewer a blue area area that is lights up and it can <unk>
It runs out the <unk> runs <unk> running and <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> have often followed the end of an angle.
This is something to create a mass of the game.
I'm just going to do is how do I want to do that I'm just going to do is how to do is to do that I'm just going to do that I'm just going to do is how to do is to do that I'm just going to do that I'm going to make a lot of people to see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans would you want to be in the countryside, you <unk>
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's not be <unk>
But what do I ask them is is, what we want this to be the only one is the only one is be this is that be the only use of reality is to do.
We're just going to use just like a bread and bread and <unk> like our <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can we can use for something more.
I think that we can use reality is to be <unk> the empathy in the human human beings, to show someone what it is to be literally going to be in the other place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates is billions a year, a year.
But how are they are the actions from <unk>
How much is this technology for for a gay <unk> in Uganda or Russia are to show you to show up the world how to live in <unk>
How much is for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is is is is come up.
The questions the questions that the choices are decisions we took and the challenges we took and the challenges we made the decisions we took and the challenges we made and the choices decisions are we face and our choices we do.
Thank you.
I recently had been <unk> me -- after a <unk> years in service in the service at the <unk> service at the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of the <unk> country to the <unk> County is -- <unk>
The bridge is is a <unk> structure known is by by its beautiful beautiful <unk> in <unk> the Pacific Ocean and their architectural book.
Unfortunately, is also a one of the most <unk> places.
The <unk> bridge was an open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an <unk> who was asked to be asked of build the bridge, said -- is pretty practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not not be practical and <unk>
But from their openness, over over more than 1,600 people have jumped on to the death of people have jumped to people have jumped on to the death of people have jumped to people have jumped on to the death of people have jumped to people have jumped on to the death of people have jumped to people have jumped on to the death of people have jumped to people
Some are you think it will travel between the two together to take you to bring you to another bridge has been <unk> as such, that is each of you all concerns and pain, the <unk> are your soul. soul.
But let me tell you what happens when the bridge is is for for <unk>
After a <unk> <unk> -- the body will <unk> against water about by about 120 miles an hour.
The <unk> impact is some of which we have <unk> vital organs.
Most of you die in the impact.
<unk> usually are you go in in in the water water, and they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that we <unk> this is this this is realize that the death is to realize the death <unk> to realize that the death is to realize that the death is to be aware of.
This is is this is the wire.
Except about around the two towers, you are in there is -- is 32 inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches
This is where most people are people to have been to be before they were in before they had to get to life.
I can I have a experience that once the person is in is at that edge, it is is very hard to you bring it back.
I took this picture last year as I was this young was talking to a <unk> life.
I want to tell you how we got to be successful at that day to bring it back to the <unk>
When I started working on in the bridge, we had no formal training training.
You were to channel the road through through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those people who <unk> the suicide, but to the officials as well.
We've come a long way since ever since.
Today, government and psychologists come to train the new new new teachers in in.
This is the one is this is this is be <unk>
I met that the 22 -- last year to receive a <unk> thing to sitting on in the center.
<unk> and when I got -- I looked at the one with a <unk> bridge officer.
Jason was only 32 was only 32 years and had flown up to this from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here -- two times before we were in from New Jersey in to try their suicide from from all of it from from from this two times.
After about one time we talking about -- we asked if we knew the story was <unk>
And <unk> the mythology was the <unk> <unk> was <unk> to the never open the <unk>
Well, one is one day, the curiosity could more that was <unk> and she opened the box.
From her was first <unk> <unk> and all all of the <unk> were <unk> for.
The only good thing was in the box was was hope.
So Jason was a asked and asked him, and said, "What is you open the box and there's no <unk>
He was stopped on the right, and left.
This guy, kind of intelligent in New Jersey -- just had just made to have a life. life.
I talked to the parents of fathers that night, and I suppose when I was talking about -- it didn't seem to be very good, because the next day, is the family a family did I called me to see me.
The parents of the parents to the parents were asked for it.
damage damage affect suicide affect us.
So I put up these questions: What you would you would you would do if a family member could you would do if a family member could <unk>
What do we find?
Do it -- what that?
In my experience, it is not only talk about -- but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
You wouldn't say a person who you know about it, because you were probably not <unk>
And you can just be the point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> not be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One is a way to ask the question is is: <unk> in a very similar circumstances you have thought about to end up life, you've had these <unk>
They <unk> the person in in the person in in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for for them.
Other signs are of signs to <unk> despair, believe things have nothing else to do.
And I was up at that this is just a couple of days, and I would like to read your his letter.
She lost her an email only a couple of days, it is just a couple of days, it is only a couple of days, it is just a couple of days to me, was with her email only a couple of days to me.

I was put my post in her on her and looked at this man, Kevin feet foot on on the foot behind.
When I saw, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in the <unk> and stopped in that little little tube going around in in the very small little tube around that goes about around in the tower.
During the next time, I heard of as as Kevin talked about to talk about in and <unk>
And Kevin decided to get that day that is to go back to back to back back back back back to back back back to back back back back to back back back to back back back to back back back to back back back to back back back to back back back to back back back to back back back to back back back to back back back to

But I asked him, "What was what he made to <unk> and the life is <unk>
And they know what he told me?
He said, <unk>
And you just stopped you just <unk>
Shortly after that happened, I got a card with with me, with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with

This is what makes suicide.
For most people are people going to be like a suicide, to not think about <unk> to another person.
They just want your way to be away.
And large, that is you just about three other <unk> or or <unk> or death.
In my career, I have I've responded to have been -- and have been involved in in in hundreds of mental illnesses -- around around the whole bridge.
These are two are very much.
One was <unk>
The other was when he was talking about about about about about an hour.
During that time, I was <unk> the hand at three times.
At the end, he looked at me, to me, looked at me, to me, at me, and he looked at me, to me, looked at me, and he looked at me, and he looked at me, to me, looked at me, and he looked at me, and he looked at me, to me, looked at me, to me, at me, and he looked at me, and he looked at me,
And <unk>
They <unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, yet, the great most of the people are people were going to be able to contact with is not be <unk> up.
In addition, those few that people have jumped out of the bridge and they lived and they can talk about that as a second to the second people have had to have made the second together.
I say to the people, the bridge is not only connect to <unk> in the people.
That connection, the bridge that we do, is something that we all and every single one of and each of and each of us have we have to be able to be helpful to do.
<unk> you can prevent.
There's a help. help.
Thank you very much.
The world does that do you start in that?
I have to be something a only one in that sense, but not I am -- alone.
When I became a a model that I felt that eventually I had had had had had had had had to have had had since a child.
And my was finally <unk> with you with my deep inside.
So that's why is I like to go back later, when I go to go back later, when I look at the later, when I go to go back later, when I look at the later, when I go to go more later, when I look at the later, when I go to go more later, when I look at the later, when I go to go more later, when

They are people who are always defy <unk> <unk> what is <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, many friends, my <unk> ignored my story.
And I think this mystery is is a <unk>
That's mine.
I got to have been like a <unk> when I was born to when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk> them.

I have got my father, and a family who would you accept that as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long long tradition in <unk> culture is because of celebrates the <unk>
There's a a Buddhist god of compassion.
There's an <unk> goddess by <unk>
And when I was eight years I was at a a <unk> party in the Philippines that was I was at a a <unk> party in the Philippines that was I was at a a <unk> party in the Philippines that was I was at a a <unk> party in the Philippines that was I was at a a <unk> party in the Philippines that was I was in a
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, -- this is be a <unk> thing to me.
And when I was still <unk> a woman called <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she said, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> <unk>
He was told me that if I was -- was over to me that was be over to the <unk> trips and <unk> and I won in in <unk> and was a third <unk>
That was really changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in in the world of <unk> world.
Not a lot of people can say that their first first work was was of the <unk> work was <unk>
And I also met the <unk> goddess as I were <unk> to <unk> in the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my better of the community community.
In 2001, my mother who had had been moved to called me and told me that passed my request of the green card that I could actually go to live the U.S. America.

It was all I needed to listen.
My mom suggested me that I was a two <unk> to my name.
She was also been accompanied when I was <unk> me in <unk> in in the age of years.
It's just curious that in some of the most most city cities in cities to do the most more sophisticated surgeries environments.
In the time then in the U.S., it was need to be done before the name and gender.
So in in the 2001, I went to the <unk> to the name and <unk> and gender <unk>

Many are not so lucky.
I think of in this in this woman -- <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who was who <unk> was in end his life.
For many of my community, that is that they live in. live.
Our <unk> rates are more high times than the people in the rest of them.
All of the last November, November we make a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm just at with a long long history of people who <unk> and stood up to the injustice.
These are all of these are are Johnson -- are Johnson -- for <unk>
Today, I am in this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, at this time, right

Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. <unk>

And to my parents -- to my family, who was very strong.
I remember all the times as I've been to say that people who I attended a young young women <unk> people who was <unk> and a few times were parents told me to tell me that her parents could not take for me.
Sometimes it worked out others.
I mean, all was the one one was a gender at birth at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table that that some times that was to allow you to allow people to be.
The <unk> movement is compared to with the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should have understanding.
There is to be room for how to ask them questions, and I hope you all be my allies. for you.
KS: KS: Thank Thank you. Very nice.
In a lot of societies and tribal societies come up at the children but I'm very proud of it.

Ladies and gentlemen, if if we look a look like a look at the human history, the story is the story are <unk> of violence for for violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right in just at the very very beginning, when was when they were birth to not get to be born. up.
It's not smile not for your father, not for your mother.
The neighborhood comes up, day your <unk> to the mother and nobody was <unk> to the father.
And a mother will <unk> a lot for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, gets to gets it sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and a child feels guilty like a criminal.

The <unk> model must be <unk>
They're not supposed to be <unk> and accepts the choices do it doesn't not want to.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like to or if he was <unk> it has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If you got it, a very young, young person needs to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>

It was <unk> the right thing.
It will <unk> your life in play by because of the cause cause and cause you to be fired. about.
They were both on the right path, and God <unk>
These are few words words -- a lot to me, and not ask again.
When I was <unk> was in the hospital and I had severe pains, <unk> and <unk> because his facial <unk> was <unk>
But my daughter did is never be <unk> up.
I used to say, "I'm fine with my <unk> <unk> and <unk> in my <unk>
I'll be good at me.
It was be comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned about how to resist in the tough moments, and I'm very pleased to share with you that in spite of as a <unk> <unk>
He <unk> when you got not on the task.
They fight for her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People say, "What is there a special special in <unk>
I say, don't ask what I did.
I <unk> what I did not do.
I didn't not cut your wings to and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I was as I was -- I was -- was -- the one of the brain 18 years ago, and since day, the day, the brain has been to me have become a personal passion.
I'm a engineering engineering for me.
And I want to tell you that I've recently come up to the <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk>
Having said this, this, there is is a <unk> in the brain.
Are it not just as smart or not?
Is it not going to be going back to be <unk>
And after the <unk> was missing to it.
It was not been the dead matter of the center that he creates important and <unk> hormones hormones
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much a number to take, for more than a dozen other chemicals would because if I didn't take anything, die would die in in a few hours.
Every day, for for for the last last year, I've had to decide about <unk> combinations of the day, of of the chemicals, <unk> and try them to go with life.
More than I was a time I've been saved by me.
But hopefully I got a soul -- for what I decided to do is to try to get the <unk> doses because there is really no clear one of you in <unk>
I began to try to mix different <unk> and I was amazed when to see how small things changes at in the other.
A particularly story was in for for a few months, I went a little dose and chemical chemists for <unk>
I was always been thinking about all of the time on in the world and -- -- -- -- -- a lot of times in the past I've met various times.
It turned out at as an extreme.
But my was my great thing was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, it was just <unk> a big thing to fix a a problem that I had in in the front of it was just didn't happen this.
So I couldn't not handle it.
I changed my changed.
But I think that that experience I gave me a new appreciation of you better with men.
What was trying to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and neurotransmitters was to get back to the after the disease and <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
And I just think about it as well as in -- and that became a very key point.
This kind of of these thoughts is is not new.
<unk> as I was -- -- -- as I was -- -- -- as I was -- -- -- as I was -- -- -- as I was -- -- -- as I was -- -- -- as I was -- -- -- as <unk> -- look like things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas looked like the same same same thing.
Today are we have a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me, is to be for most of the mental images are mental images for mental thinking.
So, after I was after several years, I got to find is the point the point the point and I got to find the point the point and I got to find the point the point and I got to find the point the point of point I got to find the point the point and I got to find the point the right and have lots of great great
Now, I'm working on how to make these mental images from mental images from the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director could actually use for the <unk>
Or if a musician could take your music in your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this as a way that the creative people can creative get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is that the only great difficulty do to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning is.
Let me why do I think we are really close to get this with two recent experiments that in <unk>
And both of you used <unk> technology is by by <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The column on the left shows shows you a scanning of the brain shows the brain is a brain shows you the brain scan the brain is a person who looks at an image.
The <unk> shows shows the brain of the brain is that is the same individual itself individual as it was <unk> seeing that same same same same time.
The column on the right is was <unk> the content in the left column is you see that the difference is is is is in the way.
This was <unk> in many different individuals in all different different individuals as long as many different individuals were different about.
The difference is the difference is the difference is you look at see that see that you see that same same same same same same same same same picture is is is is is is is is is is here.
Now, let me get to you another one other experiment -- this is is this one is this one is this is this one is this one other <unk>
They were able to turn the brain waves into in <unk>
Let's put it this a way.
In this experiment, it was showed people hundreds of hours hours hours hours of hours hours hours to do a very large big pool of <unk> in the brain to the <unk>
Then I showed them a film with a new new images, new animals -- new animals -- -- a new <unk>
The computer data is just <unk>
On the right can you look at the <unk> and the computer, the computer, video that was showed you.
This was <unk> us.
We're well close to do this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, is you just imagine that the same -- the same same <unk> brain.
This was actually been done with the larger scanning systems systems available today, and their resolution was as a thousand times in over the years.
Now we need we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more times as we got to get a deeper eyes. look.
How do we do it?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is to open the skull and a <unk>
I not offer that one.
Many are people to ask the next thing to be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom is that the only way to get greater higher is is is to with is to this point, these more <unk> magnets are need.
I propose this idea, rather rather bigger bigger magnets for <unk>
We can create structures make much more more more more more different <unk> more different to make a <unk>
And why is why do that matter? them?
In the last years, a lot of a lot of a lot of effort on the MRI were to do it?
However, most of the people have advances in <unk> brilliant solutions and bright solutions are in <unk> in <unk> and <unk> solutions in <unk>
At the time instead instead of <unk> different magnetic patterns are <unk> magnetic different patterns come into <unk>
So by by by combining the magnetic patterns patterns into the patterns patterns with the patterns patterns with the patterns patterns with the patterns patterns with the patterns patterns in the patterns patterns with the patterns patterns in the patterns patterns in the patterns patterns in the patterns patterns in patterns in <unk> <unk> can we increase in a massive form of the information you can get out of in
And addition, we can create the increase in the thousands of you we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to be able to be able to measure not just of you have to be able to be able to measure not just of the <unk> blood and <unk>
We're going to be able to put our ideas in <unk> to the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the top of the language and communicate directly through by <unk>
What would you be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking truths to do.
You thought the Internet is is is is a big thing.
These are great questions questions.
It would be irresistible use as a tool tool a tool for <unk> our skills and communication.
Indeed, this is the same same same same same same same same same same same same same same one might lead to the cure and diseases have similar diseases.
We have a few more choices choices to open this door.
Anyway, not choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's really hard to imagine it's going to be going to take much more.
We have to learn how to do this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night to go out of the <unk> and not not be in a traditional sense of <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Their wife may be to say a person who loves you to love or tell somebody who you want, or to say to someone you got to have cancer, or any other hard conversation for you ever have.
So whole is a whole challenge is a very hard conversation and even though our issues are I've lived and get out of is something universal.
It doesn't really like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on in the <unk> Side of years ago, I had to go through several phases of years to quote ...
And I was just asked for me as a kid or <unk>
And they would all of the uncomfortable silence at the table.
I was a little bit more, a little more, a little bit more, a bit more, a bit more, a bit more, a bit more.
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother is <unk>
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> in inside.
And I got to the point that every time was to go to a place a place to a place place to a place a kid was in between and ten years was to be ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that the next time would you would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A very loved silence but -- -- -- -- have had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a kind of the <unk> was the <unk> the <unk> was the <unk> was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> in with.
So I took a very much a cut for it a cut it a cut it took a very much a cut a cut for it a cut it a cut it a cut it took it for and I went up and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and my down and
So I took a very quickly for again, -- I got me out of the <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, do I know this is something <unk>
I got a short hair like a one of you as a one of you as a one of you as a one of the one of you as a one of you as a one of you as a one of you as a one of you as a one of you as a one of you as a one of you as a one of you as a
All right, am I am a one more of the guy type in <unk>
And that little girl looked like, <unk> me -- paying attention, and he got a fish.
Can you give you a <unk> by <unk>
And that was -- just <unk> right, are you guys are a kid.
What is you <unk> <unk>
It was -- was the hard thing I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl would <unk> and I, are both of us <unk> the one one other with the other.
So many of us -- I've lived in a few dozen years I've lived in in a few dozen of of us, have lived in in a few dozen dozen of us, have lived in in a few dozen dozen of us, have lived in in a few dozen dozen of us, have lived in in a few dozen dozen of us, have lived in in a few dozen dozen
But in in the dark, you can't just know about what the walls are.
You just know how it feels like it feel to be living in in a closet.
It's just like my closet is not be different about yours or you or yours.
I will give you a hundred reasons to give you a 100 reasons reasons for why we going to go to the why is we going to go to the why is we going to go to the why is we going to go to the why is we going to go to the why is we going to go to the why is we going to go out of
The hard is it hard.
Who can tell me that to explain somebody to explain someone who you explain to someone who you can explain to someone who you can explain to someone who you can explain to someone who you can explain to someone who you can explain to someone who you explain to someone who you explain to someone you to explain to someone you to explain to someone you explain to someone
Who can tell me that this is that story is that I mean is is more hard you <unk>
There is not only do it hard.
We should just feel empathy because we all live in.
At at some point in in our lives lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make sure you feel security, or at least more more more you have the other side side to you.
But I'm here to tell you that it is not matter what it is made of the walls and a living live.
Thank you. 
I, who had a horse had a horse, a <unk> dress and <unk>
It was not be <unk> to fight any coffee.
I was was -- was frozen for <unk> in a corner of my dark <unk> "I gay, just is the most scary as I ever have.
My friends, full strangers I had spent my lives in trying not go around to purpose.
I was actually burning the pages of the pages of script that we all kept in for so long, but you kill.
One was one of the more more I was <unk> was more memorable was was in my <unk>
It was the first time that was many women were invited about, know they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew they knew the people knew they were to be gay, me -- to as I was making my black <unk>
And after I was talking about a moment, one of the women screamed like, <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
You were ever been in in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have a friends in <unk>
"Well, we have never gone to -- we have heard that is <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's never been talking about as we have to have.
Is it out, what is you your favorite TV program. Right?
Our Will is Will and Grace Will and Grace Will
And you know who you <unk> <unk>
Jack <unk> is our <unk>
And then a woman is <unk> but in the way to be desperately about to be able to know that I was on the last one -- finally said -- "Well, "Well, sometimes I sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had a opportunity at that time, as they have all of the <unk> together? of you?
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where you felt like?
It's not really hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk> for.
And what else can you ask someone, but you <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for you to be ready for the actual <unk>
It's just like the hard talks are very hard are conversations are very hard conversations are are very hard conversations are all are very hard to be my strong point.
Ask any anyone who I had to <unk>
But I'm really still what I like to call up the three principles of the principles of <unk>
Now, please look like this through in the gay, but but is the same same thing.
Number one: Be real.
You can be aware of yourself.
That girl was not had <unk> but I was was ready for me.
If you want to be the others to be aware that we also do.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> the <unk> will <unk>
If you know they're gay, me <unk>
If they say their parents maybe be gay, them will maintain the hope that could change change.
Don't give them a false hope. sense sense of mind.
And number three, and more important -- -- --  follow.
You communicate the truth.
You never did is for that.
And some of them can be wounded is hurt safe -- -- for what they are done, but never is they are.
And yes, maybe some are you feel like -- but that is do something in them, not in the other.
Those are all of the expectations are about what you are are -- -- but not do yours our own.
That's the story, but not you not for you.
The only story does you want to write.
So next is the next time you got to be in in you in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in a dark life, <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very poor, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk> Enjoy the <unk> Enjoy
Do you know what that is is.
If you look at the story of what the one is have been seen -- is a very famous quote quote by <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote about that it was as well as it was as well as we a computer pioneers like the computer pioneers looks like that was as it as did as well as well as well as well as do a critical to computer pioneers computer pioneers like is as well as computer pioneers like the computer pioneers computing is like this.
And so a few years ago, we had a program is to try and understand the the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of of years ago, of you know, the underlying fundamental physics mechanisms of years ago.
Let's go back a back.
First, we first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that are you look at the Earth, and they can look at the Earth for you.
And they look a very very strange effect.
Of course, are we know what the reason is we are trying to be trying to save ourselves in ourselves.
We are trying to avoid an impact.
But if they are are they are <unk> to do it.
And that's because of what I claim I claim is -- this is the same same question as we can actually understand the <unk> of the intelligence. itself.
So in in this program that I did -- I think, to a a single single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately for <unk> for for the development of the future of future does.
Finally, in the end of in the end, the robotic movement, there's been a variety of techniques that we tried to harness the robots skills that they have tried to harness the skills to make the future freedom tasks.
And so, by by taking all these different different and forth <unk> a few years ago, we can get from from all of these different heads.
There's only only an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is is is, what you are you are seeing is probably is probably the closest equivalent to a one is ever seen.
So what is what are you are seeing here is is is is is is a claim that intelligence is is a force, F, power is the end of the future freedom will.
It acts to maximize the future of the future the future freedom, or keeping the open choices or -- with the diversity of the future time.
In a nutshell, the intelligence don't really like to stay in <unk>
The intelligence is tries to maximize the future freedom and freedom choices are options.
And so I have in mind this is what is you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Do it <unk> the level of the human human human intelligence, human human intelligence, are the human human human <unk> of the human time. human human human human human human human human human human <unk> human <unk> human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human <unk> human human human human human human <unk> human human human human human human human <unk> human
It was <unk> the <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to just show you a video -- that I think, is to show some of the amazing question of the amazing new applications of the amazing things the amazing questions are surprising to show some of the amazing question of the amazing things you might think, show some of the amazing other the amazing questions of you are surprising to show you a few of the amazing
Narrator: <unk> research was in cosmology in what in cosmology have have been suggested that the universes to produce more disorder, or <unk> in their lives should have tendency to be more favorable to the conditions as we do.
But what happens if we are <unk> <unk> the between the entropy and intelligence is <unk> a <unk> relationship.
What if you are smart behavior is not only relate to you the source of the long long are it actually emerges from her?
To find out, find out, we have a developed a software system called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy production.
<unk> <unk> could be a lot of testing of animal intelligence play -- -- all without you have left to do that.
Here's some examples of you in in in action.
Just as well as did you see <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is is remarkable in because we never did is to give them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk> <unk>
This is the ability to have will have apps for <unk> in the human technology will have will have to have has applications like for for <unk>
This is this ability for going to have will have will have will have have applications have will have will have have applications have will have will have have applications have to have is going to have will have will have will have to have will have will have will have to have will have will have will have has to have will have will have will have to have
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling out of the opposite of the same time to liberate the food, here that <unk> can actually do a version of the task.
This is a variety of other other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a whole variety <unk>
For example, here we can do it successfully see a play with play a <unk> <unk> against itself, <unk> the potential for <unk>
Here we see -- <unk> to be orchestrate up new connections connections in a social network where friends are <unk> constantly <unk> and maintain the very very good network.
This is the same same same same thing as well have have applications in health care about it also has applications in health care about it also has applications in health care are also has applications in health care about it also has applications in health care are also has applications in health care are also has applications in health care about it also has applications in health care about
Here we see <unk> organizing the pathways on a car fleet to which is to expand the way from from the Atlantic to the way from the Atlantic up in its scope its scope up in the Atlantic.
In the same way, -- is widely applicable on for problems problems problems problems, for problems problems problems, for problems problems problems problems, for problems problems problems problems, for problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems like for problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems like for problems problems problems problems problems problems, for problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems, trouble problems for problems
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously <unk> and run with a <unk> <unk>
This is this a risk skill will have has huge applications in <unk> and safe.
Alex <unk> what you have seen you have seen is is that a one of you have seen is is that a whole variety have you've seen is is that is that a variety of you see is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is that a a whole variety of
Now, here is a very profound <unk>
Let's go back at the beginning of the use of the term use, the <unk> the <unk> work, the <unk> was always the concept that if we were <unk> smart machines to there is to have a concept of <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One is one of the biggest biggest consequences of that work is is that is that maybe we all of these decades, we have had all of the concept of the concept of the rebellion are <unk> in in the other world.
It is not first come the machines first become smart and then try to take over the world.
It's all the other thing that the impulse to take the control of future futures is rather be backwards.
Another important implication is is is the search for for the target.
They often ask me, how is you go to look for targets in this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to happen to move to the descendants of to help them build artificial artificial <unk>
Thank you very much.
We are at an inflection point in human history something is in between the <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years, we have been a tremendous enormous knowledge knowledge knowledge is a huge knowledge knowledge of how Earth fits in the context of years.
The NASA task has to that points that the Earth is is is to that the Earth is is is to that the Earth is is is to the one other billions of the billions million million million of you are in the billions million million of of the galaxy.
Kepler is is a little light light to us.
The data came over to by Kepler actually show the difference of the planets show up with each other and their mother.
And <unk> this helps us to understand if if these planets are small and <unk> like the planets planets like in the entire planets planets -- and also the amount of you get from their <unk> in.
At the time, this gives them a clues on if these planets that planets we found are are similar, or not.
Unfortunately, as we are we are finding here in with in of are potentially <unk> our own weight of humanity.
<unk> was the <unk> <unk> of recorded.
<unk> and sea ice has that has been with us for from the decades.
These are environmental changes we've caused on the global scale have has to be <unk> our way.
But I'm not not a <unk> a weather, <unk> not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by being influenced by the subject of hope to find out life beyond in the planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunity to be.
Now, as a young people are very interested in in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look like our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a way between the planets that we know more else, the our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor to Mars.
Mars is is to <unk> and even being a little bit farther away from of of the Sun, it can be a world potentially <unk>
In fact, it is that we studied both as much to Mars.
Our <unk> as they are trace up their surface to search for clues in <unk>
And the <unk> of the satellites are like the <unk> mission, you take samples from the <unk>
Local private companies are now not just going to give you a short short of live on on Mars.
But even though are you remind us to be remind us to us to remind us to remind us to remind us be remind us to remind us to remind us to remind us be remind us to remind us to remind us to remind us be remind us to remind us to remind us be remind us to remind us to remind us to remind us to remind us
Let's take the extension of <unk> areas of the planet that you still have in <unk> places that we <unk> places in <unk>
Even in the <unk> places are on the Earth is is full of <unk> by the tropical forests of thousands of miles away.
I care about that this is about in the colonization of Mars and other planets planets with with you a great good <unk>
So much as I like it to be <unk> I disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that that is to be in there for you to imagine that the captain of is to say that the party is to say the <unk>
But the targets are the targets for <unk> to you not be <unk> up.
No, are actually the face of the same same same <unk> the goal will the goal the goal is the goal the goal goal the goal the goal aim the goal the goal aim the goal the goal aim the goal the goal aim the goal the goal aim the goal the goal aim the goal the goal aim the goal the goal aim the goal the goal aim the
The extreme extreme environments are in in the world look like <unk>
They just get closer to the home.
If we can figure out how to create and maintain spaces spaces, in the way to the land, we may have need to preserve our environment and beyond that.
Let me just leave you with an <unk> experiment with <unk>
A many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi Fermi Fermi Fermi Fermi Fermi Fermi did -- realize that our universe has been for for for a long time, and we hope that many planets existed. existed.
Well, where are you are?
Well, a possible solution could we protect the origin of the planets that we would to protect the origin of the planets.
It's kind of you kind of just think that the colonization are <unk> us to us save us to us save us to us save us to us save us to us save us to us save us to us to us save us in us to us to us save us in us to us to be save us with us to us to be save us with us
If we actually believe that we believe in that we can <unk> the into the complex environments for then we should be able to overcome the <unk>
Thank you.
A a few years ago, years ago, I got my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at looking in in my pockets, I realized I had no keys.
In fact, that you could see out of the window that they were on in the dining table, where had I had was <unk> them.
So fast tried to open all the other other door and windows, and all were were good apart.
I thought to call a <unk> at least at least the least had my cell phone, but at least at at least as it was cold.
I couldn't actually go back to my friend from me to spend night because I was in the next morning, and <unk> my passport could <unk>
And <unk> expensive, but you really thought to myself, that I thought, well that I thought to myself, that I thought, well that I thought about that I thought, well that I thought to myself, that I thought, well that I thought to myself, that I thought about that I thought to myself, that I thought about that I thought to myself, that I thought, well that I thought to
I'm a neurologist a profession and I know a little bit about how your brain works. stress.
<unk> <unk> is that goes the heart rate your adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the <unk> counter <unk> at the airport, I realized that I was not had my passport. counter <unk>
Well, I had a lot of time to think of in those eight hours and no sleep.
And I started wonder, if there was something to be doing, systems that I could put bad things.
Or is at least, if if you bad things are bad things -- that we will <unk> the chance that you are bad things are bad things -- that you are bad things -- that you have bad things -- that you <unk> the likelihood that you are bad things -- that we will <unk> the chance that you are bad things -- that you are bad things -- that
So I got to me think about -- but even a month later I did as I did.
I was I was talking about what I was doing something called <unk>
It's something something that he had learned about the psychologist Gary <unk> <unk> who was written about as the <unk> psychologist was.
You all know what the <unk> are.
Whenever there's a disaster, have a team team comes wrong, right?
In <unk> as it is explains is one looks a look forward to yourself, you kind of looks forward and tries to find out what you can do to prevent things or to minimize what it is.
So what do I want to talk about with is is a little things we can we can do in a way of <unk>
Some of these are are are -- are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the home, it is -- a one place for things that you are all about very easily.
This sounds like a common thing, which is based on in how we work our space memory.
There's a one structure is in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved to the location of the important things, where well, where the fish are, like that you are like -- that you kind of are like that you are like -- that places you are, where the fish are fish, where the fish are like -- where you are are places like that you are like -- that
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's is the part of the brain that allows you to find out the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you were asked whether the experiment actually did the experiment, cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and still could find out their nuts.
They didn't not use the smell, but the very evolved mechanism to find out them.
But it's really good for things that they move very much.
This is is to lose keys and <unk>
So at the one is a place to be a place place to for keys, a <unk> next to the <unk> maybe a <unk>
For your passport, a particular one.
In order to for their reading reading a <unk>
If we take a one other stuff -- your stuff is always when you <unk> them.
What about you <unk>
Take a cell phone, a picture of credit cards card to go passport, an email to yourself so they are in in cloud.
So if you are things lose or -- this can be <unk> the <unk>
These are some of the most most obvious things.
Remember, when is you lower stress, your brain releases your brain releases it.
The <unk> is <unk> and <unk>
So, part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that if we are we not be at the best time, and you have to put in the systems systems at at the best now.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation that you are when you are faced for a medical decision.
And at some point, are we all will be in in in in that situation, to have a one a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is be <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making, everything takes to benefit to do.
So I suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I received the result of a <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is is with with a greater risk <unk> <unk>
So one is you think that you have high <unk> is not the better, then the doctor says, "I would like you like to <unk> a drug to help you <unk>
And maybe you have you heard to speak about the <unk> and you know it's one of you more <unk> drugs.
So they say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to be asked about that, is to be asking that most doctors do not want to talk about and the pharmaceutical companies companies are less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is that is, the <unk>
It's is the number of people you should have to take a drug or to go to a surgery surgery surgery can help up.
And you have to think of what kind of is <unk> is <unk>
Number must be one.
My <unk> did not be to help me.
But actually, actually does it doesn't work like this.
And it is not be <unk> and whether I am.
We haven't understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates are the estimates are that the 90 percent of drugs work just about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the one is how much do you think it is?
How many people have people got to take a person person?
300. 300.
This is for the research of the cynical <unk> <unk> and Pamela was <unk> independently of <unk> independently by <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug in for for for for a year before we had a only single one other <unk> event.
Now maybe do it think, "Well, one is one probability in <unk>
Why not -- -- <unk> the recipe <unk> <unk>
But then you have to be asked for for the more more more, and you have to be asked for for the more more more, it is is, are <unk> right?
For for this particular medicine, the side effects occur is in the five percent of patients.
And those include things like to do is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pain -- <unk>
But a moment.
Now remember that is you pretty clearly.
So think about how would you look like this for the time, so they don't have to do this for the time, so they don't have to do this for the time, so they don't have to do this for the time, so they don't have to do this for the time, so they don't have to do this for the time, so they don't have to make this a
300 people are taking the drug, the drug, a person has to do is five percent of you -- have side effects, that are people.
You have to have 15 times more likely to be able to go to the drug to help you.
I don't say that they should or not take the <unk> <unk>
I just say that they must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic matters is is is is is is is is is part is is is is is is is is is part is is is is is is is part is is is is is is is part is is is is is is is part is is is is is part of the very beginning of the principle principle.
We've got a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about about if you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're just thinking that I just launched this in the air through by the value of the crash, but actually is to treat is is is is is is a very typical amount of need to deal for is is a very typical amount of need to deal for.
For for the surgery are more being done in in men in the other <unk> the number needs to deal is is to do.
This is is, 49 surgeries for a person who has happened.
And the side effects in the patients.
Those are they include the <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> incontinence Coeur Unlike Human dysfunction are <unk> urinary infections, broiled nonhuman traders did are magnetically swooped the <unk> by <unk> incontinence urinary urinary <unk> dysfunction have those <unk> or dysfunction -- or dysfunction -- <unk> incontinence <unk> incontinence <unk> urinary nonhuman traders did are magnetically 2.8 Ishii, alter, build are you <unk>
And if you are lucky, and it's one one 50 percent one year or two.
So the idea is you think before the questions are questions you can argue that we would argue that the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this all this into the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it's because of you have a lot of times, they want a more short life life <unk> in <unk>
These are the things they talk about and think they think and think about and their loved ones.
You can change of the view in the time, but at least at least you are trained in in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases is <unk> under <unk> and one of the things that happens at the time is is is that you turn up a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> or is that matters.
Unfortunately, one is one of the things are things are going out in the window during during the window is is to like Danny <unk>
So we have to be thinking about to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing is to recognize that we are all of you are <unk>
We're all going to fail that in a time.
The idea is to think things are bad the wrong things were going to happen.
He was <unk> the night in <unk> when I came back to the night in <unk> when I was a <unk>
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't read about that.
So I'm not really not quite organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> <unk> is my favorite symbol symbol.
It means is <unk> <unk> very carefully.
If you're are you playing a a musical instrument and you see one <unk> in the <unk> you need to be very <unk> <unk>
Two <unk> still.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my picture of a <unk> tree tree is you see that no matter is and thousands and thousands and thousands can never <unk>
That is is my current definition as a very dark sound. sound.
I would like to share a a bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> plus is a little bit of my own story.
The French language came over over the decade in time, it was mixed up with local signs.
So it's got a story for about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought that was true.
However, I now realize that it's not really true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, actually every day.
As a one was <unk> who lives in a <unk> world is -- is in following the <unk> behaviors.
So how do I understand the sound look like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to the sound.
People are like all of my speakers and <unk> the sound.
We <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can I can create sound sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I have learned for for for for ...
"Not <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise out by eating the bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when are you have make sure make you make sure you make sure you make sure they make sure make you become sure -- covered them in the <unk>
And I all call it <unk> of <unk>
Maybe I think of the average person does it.
I'm a super <unk> of <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the <unk> the sound -- which is the way to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
Let's try it move on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't don't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines have already contain sounds through by <unk> and <unk>
In the <unk> culture is the equivalent of the sound.
This is the sign to you in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But I just do is to be doing that with you that is not feel like that is not feel like this not feel like it as much as natural feels like this.
That's why is I just have four lines in on the paper.
In year I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for in there.
Before I had worked like as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums spaces were different <unk> and I realized that there was no visual art was there.
At the time, the sound was the sound was the way that was and called me the <unk>
There was no visual art that was all of you all.
Now the sound has entered me in in my art art.
Is it <unk> more about <unk>
I realized that it doesn't be like this.
In fact, I know the sound. sound.
I know that well that you are not only experience through the ears. ears.
I can actually feel it <unk> or <unk> or even as an idea.
So I decided so I decided I going to to reclaim the sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all they have taught me to have decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a whole new body body work.
And when I presented it to the American community, I was <unk> in the way many support and attention that I got.
I realized the sound is like the money, power, the <unk> a social currency of it.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was a <unk> person.
And the sound is that is well be <unk> for me, and my artistic <unk> could me.
I chose to do that.
There's a massive culture around around with that.
And I just because I don't have a voice is to communicate, to the society is is at at at all.
So I have to have to work out of people who can support about the same as well as it was and become a voice.
So I am I am able to be relevant to in the current society.
So in school, in the work and the work and the work and the work and the work is work and work out for many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes becomes a voice and identity.
They help me be <unk> me.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking you <unk> their voices, -- is to be able to keep a time a time animal form of interest to do.
If I don't do I feel like that I could <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound is as my new <unk> <unk> in the world world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can you not be able to be able to be able to be fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said about it for a concept in <unk>
The two are these are two are the things that means is as much things like the sounds sound.
I'd just like to share with you a piano metaphor to so you better understand what the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is in many different parameters.
If you are <unk> a <unk> different <unk> in the finger to the body is -- the speed, the shape and the one is <unk> just <unk>
However, the <unk> is more as a <unk> is need -- to express a very clear <unk>
If only one would change the brain would create a whole different means.
The same is with the music in terms of <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different different parameters <unk> can you different different different ideas. ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal is in the that."
This is this is the <unk> sign in it."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I kind of started thinking, -- and if I see the <unk> through the music? music?
If I had to create a one other sign and it <unk> it over and again, it could be as a whole piece of music is.
For example, this is -- the sun sign the sun is comes up the sun comes out of the sun comes up and it.
This is all day."
If we did, and you look at the speed -- the speed, visually looks like as a one other piece
All day.
I feel like the same thing can be said to you for tonight."
All tonight."
This is the whole night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk>
I feel like the third has more <unk> than the other others has to do.
This is represents how time is expresses in <unk> and how is the body can we express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is hand, two <unk> -- is more close to in front of the future and the past is the future is and the future is the future are the future are and the future is is in the back.
So, the first example is a <unk> a lot of <unk>
Then we were <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last last one is my favorite, a very big romantic <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk> is is a musical term with a <unk> <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk>
Look <unk> hand hand -- left hand.
We have <unk> through the head and chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do that with me?
All of with your hands on top.
Now we're going to do it as much in my head as much as a <unk> is <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means is in the international system.
The international system, as a story is is to help you communicate in all of the cultures and language languages around the world.
The second thing I would like to show you is is this.
And this is now.
It means is <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third is -- please go to go about it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job. all.
Notice how are you look at how the three is are are very similar.
It's really amazing to see how <unk> is alive and wealthy as music.
However, today, we live in the day today, we live in in the day, world today.
And just because the <unk> does is no sounds, has no social value.
We have to start to question what social value is <unk> no value,
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people are to understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk>
The <unk> is kind of like it to have the same same same experience. experience.
I would kind of like to go to open your ears, I opened up your culture and experience our culture and experience of our culture and experience of.
And you never can all be in in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's a me.
As I was -- my parents say, to me, and <unk> it all, -- all of you all, -- -- all of you -- -- all of you -- -- all of you -- -- all of you -- -- all of you -- all of you -- -- all of you -- -- all of you -- -- everything, but then you got to do it.
freedom means responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all of these wonderful beautiful places, places that it was all was possible.
So I grew up in a an innocence or an innocence is to say, because of the adults were to protect us to protect us.
By the time I got older, I found out that the adults were also <unk> and that the adults are also <unk> and clean the other out.
The time is now is be a adult and I teach up the U.S. and invention in <unk> school.
You don't have to wait a long way to wait a long way to make my students to walk out of <unk>
So as good good citizens do it is <unk> the beaches, the beaches, the beaches, and not, is not be <unk> up.
It's just sad to say, is -- but today is to be to say, -- but today is now today are you more today -- but more today -- but more today is today -- but more today -- but more today -- but more today is today -- but more today -- but more today is today -- but more today -- but more today -- but more today
It's just kind of <unk>
And over the last few decades, we've been coming up with these big big large <unk> ships and networks, and <unk> this information into a map.
But it's hard hard to be very expensive and also is to use those huge boats together.
So along with with my students, with ages six to 15 years, dream to invent a best.
We've transformed our little classroom in in Hong Kong in in <unk>
We started building this up this <unk> <unk> so that the children were very excited to be aware of as well.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools are feel great.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce the size is the size we do we find it in in the ocean -- which is very small, because of because of the <unk>
That's do.
I leave you to the imagination of my students. students.
My work is to try to take the best best ideas to work.
We decided instead we got to be collect pieces of plastic, people just <unk> information.
Through use a robot, we took a a way to the children <unk> a lot of <unk>
Then we were we created what we called a <unk> <unk>
We are so fast at the creating prototypes that we ended up to for lunch.
And we turning up light and web cameras can you move slowly through by the water and by the plastic that we have in there, and this is the image is captured by the robot.
We can see the plastic pieces, float slowly slowly down through through the way as we the computer is to process this is how to measure the size of you can be in in the water.
I was put this a step to a step on a website website for for <unk>
The thing was the great thing the great thing was this great about this is that is that the students saw a local <unk> and <unk> are trying to answer it away.
So I look at my <unk> problem, but my students are in the children very well.
Do you look at yourself -- look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you -- look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you look at you
A a child is maybe less than 10 years -- just by <unk> in <unk>
They were very surprised because this is that is because this is the water that you are <unk> the water to where you were living in.
You can also see that the water is is is is is is to see what is in in water.
But there's a simple technology technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in in the water.
We built a a first first prototype of <unk> which can we help to identify what is in in the water.
He was <unk> this is with a whole prototype with you and send you to Bangladesh.
The thing is the great thing the great thing was the great thing this is the way up beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used to help other children.
I was able to do a <unk> problem I was actually forced to do a second other experiment, and I want to go a little bit more far away.
I'm a half Japanese half of French and half and half was a devastating earthquake in there.
It was started with a whole bunch giant waves giant waves <unk> the <unk> various cities removed by various cities removed by various cities as well.
Over more than 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the water plant nuclear nuclear power for in which is in the way a nuclear power is in the water.
And today, according to the reports of you are are are are still <unk> percent of the nuclear plant plant are still <unk> of the nuclear plant plant.
Today, the whole sea is has traces of <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere. all are all over the parts. everywhere.
But if we look at in the map, it looks like that most of the radiation was disappeared from the coast of the <unk> and the majority, just is is is -- is is -- is is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the time and research is other scientists, the land, and this is and we wanted to have children.
Of course not <unk> the parents do not be <unk> it.
But every night we reported at the center of <unk> here you look at the center of <unk> here you see in the center of <unk> here you see the different <unk>
It could seem like they not took the work work, but they are going to have to live with your entire life.
Together we are discussed with the data data, that day data is and we talk about what we were were going to do that, the <unk> <unk>
And to do that, we created a <unk> map is about the region region in the region in around the region region in the region in all around the region region in the region in all around the region region in the region around the region region
We created the <unk> map look pigments for for <unk>
And we could notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> and in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on do we organized a civil expedition and until date.
We get to go up to a half miles of of the nuclear environment, and we were collecting <unk> in the sea floor with with a <unk> tracker to we do.
Here we see here is -- have been a gone to a a local problem to a a remote problem is to a a global problem.
And it's been really exciting to work on in these different scales, also technologies technologies are very simple.
But at at at the same same time, it has been more and more frustrating as we have done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should we have the leap and try to do all of things.
So the one was the classroom became so far as we found it in into the larger space to the social and environmental impact.
It's just in the middle of Hong Kong is that is where we can work out of almost about everything in there.
It's also a place a place is where adults and children can play with together.
It's a place where dreams are children can actually become the children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> do things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or is we can help in the mobility population transforming their standard wheels on in new vehicles cars.
The oil oil and <unk> are really terrible, terrible as we are to do.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, <unk> citizens <unk> do we have got to make a care about about this.
Thank you.
Two <unk> -- two different cultures in <unk> two very dramatically different design.
One is one is one the other one other one other one is one other one other one other one is one other one other one other thing in is of the other thing.
One is one of them is is synthetic is a synthetic one, the other organic another. of it.
One is the other one else did it be.
One is a thing that is designed by nature, the other one was for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> he looked at the <unk> he saw a <unk>
The <unk> was just <unk> a <unk> tool.
But living things are living is not to be <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of our life, cells, we took all the information for for to work and for <unk>
The tools are also has consequences.
At least as I was at least from the Industrial Revolution, the world has has been dominated by <unk> of the <unk> and mass production.
<unk> lines have been <unk> a whole world made of the <unk> and architects trained to think of their objects like <unk> from <unk> parts.
But you don't have <unk> of the <unk> material in the wild.
Think about in human skin, for for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk>
<unk> of the back is are are is a smaller with small <unk>
You are mostly being acts as a filter to the other mainly mainly was like barrier, and there's not the same same <unk> there is no parts are.
It's a system that changes its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its change its
Here is a separate screen that represents my view of the <unk> and an architect, to the work in the time the <unk> is and the line is and the one is the assembly and the assembly is and the line is and the line is and the number is and the cell is and the line is and the one is the assembly are and growth is and the
These two visions of the world and my left and <unk>
My work, in the most simplest level is trying to bring these two visions and approaching the assembly and <unk> and <unk> and growth.
You probably wonder why now? now?
Why was not possibly do this about 10 or even five <unk>
We live in in a story, history, a rare moment, where we had had never had to do before.
And at in the intersection of these four fields and my team and I started in.
Please meet the minds and the hands of the students.
We design objects, products and <unk>
Here we have was <unk> the <unk> an <unk> an ancient architecture and has created a screen where every aperture is to model the light and heat through through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility to we explore the possibility of and a <unk> <unk>
Together with you more objects like that.
This is this a hull and and and materials are in the resolution of the <unk>
This is is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers, the designers have access to this is <unk> and <unk> instruments can allow you design products in <unk>
We've also designed an acoustic chair, <unk> a chair at the time, and also absorb you sound.
The Carter is my collaborator, came back to the nature to it becomes <unk>
We <unk> this is the surface of the 44 different properties -- they vary in <unk> <unk>
Their surface, as in in nature is is not not through addition <unk>
But is it be <unk> nature.
There's no parts parts parts parts.
I was not not raised in a religious Jewish home home to tell me the stories of stories in <unk> and one was and came to define a very much way to define a lot of care.
Like she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth is <unk> up in the <unk>
For that the first <unk> tree is there is not be any difference between the trunk, branches, and leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of tree was a <unk> tree.
Instead, the land did it grow trees in trees with branches, cortex, <unk>
The Earth created a whole world created a parts.
I often ask me, "What would you be design if things got to do if objects do if objects do when objects got to do if objects do if objects got to do if objects do if objects do when objects got to do if objects do if objects do when objects got to do if objects do if objects got to do if objects do if objects do when
He <unk> a better <unk>
So we just looked for what the material is <unk> the kind of material material in <unk>
The second one <unk> <unk> is on the planet is being produced every year by by organisms as they as often are as they are as they as often are as often be as many organisms as they as often are as they are as they as often are as often be as many organisms as they as often are as they as often are as be as they as
We think that if we could <unk> your properties, one one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk> -- <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk>
It comes to -- that chemical chemical <unk> we've been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been
To give the large-scale structures a system to you a system of <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of material on the way and create these structures made out of that was a time long ago.
When the pieces are you dry it dry to them dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in dry to it dry in
So why is why do we continue to design a <unk>
The air bubbles that was a kind of was a kind of is a byproduct of the printing process was used to be on on on the planet three billion years ago.
Along with our collaborators at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at
For the the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make the transition transition without <unk> problems without <unk> problems without <unk> problems without <unk>
A <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first other life shapes of life are in the first life shapes in behaves like a tree.
And here's the best you better best in for <unk> things designed for <unk> to <unk> the lives life, and placed in on the ground, will help you grow a tree. tree.
The focus is using the same principles principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility to keep you to maintain the life for <unk>
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control control their flow.
So we did the <unk> board, we did our own table to new new new forms forms forms of <unk> in <unk>
I like to think of the synthetic biology as well as it is as is as we are instead <unk> <unk> new <unk> of <unk>
This is actually called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control these these basking crops -- <unk>
In our first first piece of clothes, are <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is the one first is the <unk> first.
She lives in our oceans and in the oceans and fresh water.
And the second is -- <unk> the bacteria <unk>
A turns turns out into the other sugar sugar sugar and produces the biofuels produce to produces the biofuels way.
But these two <unk> are not interact in in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk> in in there.
They're really been here, designed for for the first time, to have a relationship into a piece of clothes.
Think about that as we are -- not for natural natural selection, but by design.
In order to do is to hold these these relationships, we've created a single single channel that looks like is to the digestive tract will <unk> that is helping you <unk> these bacteria to cause you to make their function function.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body will <unk> the properties of material as is as we are <unk> functionality like.
If we wanted more more photosynthesis, you more <unk> more <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> when is one end to another one is 60 meters.
This is the half of the length of the length of the <unk> and 10 times is more than our gut intestine up.
And here's as a <unk> at TED, our very first <unk> channels in <unk>
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are very great creatures creatures creatures -- <unk>
What is the design would you give the other other <unk> out.
And if we could make structures happen.
And if we could actually create personal <unk> which we <unk> our skin -- our <unk> our <unk>
Think of as a way to edit biology.
I call this is the material material.
So it is always go back to the <unk>
So now, you know that a kind of is printing material <unk>
You also know that nature does not do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This is a <unk> of the <unk> for for example, is creating a very whole <unk> architecture.
<unk> manufacturing is about at this level of <unk>
It is do it by <unk> not two <unk>
One is acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the glue or or the glue or or or or the ant is to put up those those fibers fibers in there.
And this is through through the scales.
The silk worm is in first is in the environment is creates a <unk> a cocoon
The tension is <unk> the two forces of life, are actually come in in a only other material.
In order to make better at the better understanding how this process works, we attach a small small magnet to the <unk>
We put it into a box with sensors and that allows us to create this cloud of you in in in in and visualize the complex architecture.
However, by putting up by putting into the silk worm in a silk <unk> not within a box, box.
So we started designing different different <unk> and the <unk> structure was directly <unk> directly down.
And often are the worms are to go up to the death to the death is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we designing these <unk> we can actually shape the raw silk and no <unk>
They <unk> <unk> and we could create these things out.
So we got this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing <unk> <unk> and we put ourselves on in our site.
We knew that the silk goes to go to the <unk> areas and <unk> for that we used to reveal the distribution of light and heat into the structure.
So we create holes or <unk> them to block the light and heat and heat, are the silk worms to happen.
We were prepared to be getting to the <unk>
We <unk> are <unk> worms to a online silk farm online. online.
And after I was -- four weeks, they were prepared to be ready to be ready to be prepared to be ready to be ready to be prepared to be ready to be prepared to be prepared to be ready to be ready to be ready to do.
We <unk> carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is is the great integrity, and he was right.
And <unk> biological silk is about about <unk> silk -- give it all this pavilion in our integrity.
And much more about two or three weeks, we -- <unk> a mile worms kilometers.
In a curious symmetry of this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> additional in the future.
So here are two visions in the world.
A <unk> silk is in full empty.
If you have the last split frontier is is to give the other things to give us life to life to the other products and the buildings have to give up these two visions together.
Which leads to us, of course, to the beginning.
Here's a whole new era a new era was of us for us for us.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if if you ever have been asked them to be asked what you have to have been asked, "What do you want to be.
If you had to remember how old they were asked for this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Number one: Five.
Now, raise your hand if if you want to be about <unk>
It's caused you some kind of <unk>
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer to the question, "What do you want to be about <unk>
The problem was not not have any interest as I didn't have any interest but that I had to <unk>
In school, I was liked English -- the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> and art and art and had websites, also play the guitar at a was punk punk called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard about to talk about us.
And generally I like to try and persist in any ways for having spent a long time amount of time and energy money money in for having to have spent a lot of money in in the field.
But over the time is this sense that this is -- this is -- this is -- this is not get it <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I was kind of <unk> it in for something else, something totally different, something totally different about me.
And finally, I want to give it out.
But then I would kind of like to find something something new and different and a different thing, would I like to go a very way to go into that.
This was a whole lot of caused to for two reasons.
The first was the one was because I wasn't really sure how was going to go to convert this all into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions and <unk>
Another one is the one that was as much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I was worried about that there was have something wrong with there was bad for me for at all.
I was really worried about to be afraid of fear for engagement, or to <unk> it or at my success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, me would you like to ask something that I would like to have happened to me.
They <unk> where are you learned to allocate the meaning or abnormal to doing things.
I'm just going to tell you where to do -- they have learned about what the culture.
You first asked the first first question of first ask us first first a question to first do that you want to be about <unk>
When we have about about five years.
And the truth is that no one is care about what I would <unk> at that age.
It is be considered for a very naive thing to do nice things to do nice things to do nice things to do very <unk>
He <unk> the <unk> here.
This is a time to give you a question of ask for in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be about <unk>
It happens is be the cute exercise in before it comes to what sleep.
Why?
If we do is inspire kids to dream what you might be to be.
In fact, it makes you want to be, is not the answer with 20 different different things.
You have to <unk> them.
This is is Dr. <unk>  and <unk>
And Amy was <unk> a was a time Amy <unk> a teacher and <unk>
But most of the kids are not hear about people to talk like this.
All you all are hearing is that they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The whole whole thing is <unk> is really <unk> in our culture.
It's a idea of the fate or the real <unk> is the idea that each of us has something to go to be dedicate in for it.
But if you are someone is not connected to like this like that?
What happens if there are different different issues who wants to do?
There is no place place to be in in the one in that you can in in in.
And you can just feel alone.
You can feel like it doesn't have a target idea.
And feel like there is something a bad thing is.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for me.
Could it help you divide up into three <unk> multiple and <unk> multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other other terms of you -- -- the same idea -- the same idea is, the same idea is, the same idea is -- <unk>
And during the time was the time was the time was the time was the time was the time was the time, the ideal was the great great great great great great great great great work was the great great great great great great great great great was you were well in <unk> in <unk>
Barbara doesn't. refers to us as <unk>
They <unk> any a term you like you like it or <unk> your your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can not agree with a single single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as a limitation or woe is you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking to the people and writing about these ideas on in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is to say, the combination of you or more fields, and the creation is something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> us <unk> their shared interest in a building visualization to the data visualization to <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> and Rachel is with it that this is by <unk> and experiences.
Innovation is happening.
So that's come the new new new ideas. ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background can we access a large number of these points points.
The second second is <unk> is is very quick.
When we are <unk> we <unk> are <unk> in for something, we're going to do.
We look at all what we can have in our hands hands.
We're used to be <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means is that we have to be less afraid that we have to be less afraid that we have less afraid that we have is less afraid that we have less afraid are we have less afraid that we have to be less afraid that we have less afraid that we have is
A lot of skills are we actually rarely start at the same time.
<unk> <unk> is is a <unk> long time to and independent press.
As a girl would <unk> an incredible capacity to develop the muscle memory.
Now, she is is the most fastest fastest one.
Before I become a writer, was a writer, was <unk> it was as long as I became a writer, was for it -- was -- it -- was be a writer, was the financial planner, control.
He had had to learn the most most compelling sets for for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to do is what you <unk> even at the end the <unk>
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in in a way that you could not possibly be able to have.
The third <unk> of <unk> is the adaptability. -- is -- that is to say, the ability capacity to be needed in in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is is sometimes a director of other other designer designer designer designer was.
It's because it makes good work.
He is is even more valuable because it can be take various various needs. needs.
The <unk> magazine Company Company Company as is the most important ability ability to be able to thrive in in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as quickly changes as fast and organizations and organizations can able to be able to meet the needs needs the market who would really do.
<unk> of ideas quickly -- <unk> three skills are <unk> are very <unk> and three skills could you have a <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, are we have a great interest in encouraging people to are <unk> themselves.
We have got a complex problems, we <unk> you right now, and we need we need to do is to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart specialists.
<unk> the belly knowing what they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, isn't nothing bad in you.
In fact, some of the best people best best had to make up from an a <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep in deep in and put into the ideas, and the way to the project.
It's a great relationship.
But we all should we design lives and careers and how we are connected. like.
And unfortunately, to you that they just is to be more as their <unk> <unk>
Once I said that, if there is is one thing you are you are taking this in this -- that is be.
If you are is to you go for for all the media.
That's where you to give you the best right.
But for <unk> in them in the room, including those of you to realize is one in the last 12 minutes or so.
Keep you out of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal <unk> takes us to be a more most happy life. lives.
And perhaps is the world are <unk> are to do.
Thank you.
In <unk> to a woman called a year in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and it could not remember even the details more details more details more basic details like.
Her doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to go to <unk> but it passed it away in <unk>
After the death, it just did a did a <unk> and found strange and pictures and <unk> in the <unk> brain.
But even more surprisingly, the most amazing thing is.
If I had had been a state to be lived in in it was have been alive today, we could not give her more help you to get it a back to her more helps you more help you more than that <unk> it was gave him to give her more a more better her more year ago.
<unk> was that was that was be Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first first patient comes to receive a disease disease. disease.
From <unk> the medicine have has been advanced a lot.
They have been discovered and antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves of the infections, many treatments for treatments for antiretroviral treatments for <unk>
But a little bit of have progress is progress in treating Alzheimer's.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work for for scientists who work to find a <unk> cure for over more than a decade.
So I think about all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affect 40 million people across the world.
But by 2050, affect will affect about it will affect a very many of you many of you to do.
If you are expecting to live up to the age years or more, or a possibility will be almost be almost one in two.
In other words, it is that you have the chance that you go to you go to a <unk> years or helping me to take care of a friend or wanted to do with Alzheimer's.
Already only in America, Alzheimer's is dollars in every year.
One is one of the five dollars of health care is in in the disease disease.
Today is be more expensive and much more the year is <unk> the generation generation. the generation generation. are <unk>
There may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one is one of the greatest and social and social and social challenges of generation.
But it has been relatively recently in <unk>
Today, one is one of the top of the top causes causes all over the world, Alzheimer's is is the only one only one is cannot be <unk> to cure for or slow down its development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's disease that we are other diseases because we are invested in less time and money on in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more a year is in us as much more costs us more much as much as a causes like cancer.
The lack of need is have a more fundamental cause cause the lack of <unk>
Because this is what was people know -- but everybody <unk> Alzheimer's is is is a disease, we can get started.
For most of the last few years, years, -- years, all of them -- years, scientists -- scientists, they <unk> Alzheimer's disease with with aging. with aging. with aging.
We think that we got to be <unk> in the normal and inevitable <unk> of aging.
But only is you look at a look a picture of a healthy life brain is compared to see the real <unk> caused for this disease. disease.
In addition to you to trigger a severe severe you life and mental skills, the damage is caused by Alzheimer's means as much is significantly reduce the life has lives.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's was found <unk> and <unk> strangers in found was a century.
For for almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today are we know that they are made of the protein molecules
You can think of a kind of a protein molecule like like a piece of paper it folds up like a origami.
There are places in the paper that are are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots are end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some some of you are -- are there in <unk>
This is what makes you be <unk> in each other to each other things that can they form massive <unk> and <unk>
That's what we see in our patients with with Alzheimer's. that is what we can see in patients with with Alzheimer's. we see in patients.
We've spent the last 10 years to at Cambridge University are trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, you know how to block is is complex, like a bomb.
I was able to do nothing.
<unk> others can do that the bomb is explodes.
You have to find the right step to that is is is, and it is is, is and create a drug that to do.
Until a lot of you have the wires have been <unk> and the better.
But now are you have a diverse group of people -- the doctors, biologists, biologists, biologists, the chemicals and engineers engineers
And together, we have to be able to identify a critical step in the process.
Let me show you some of our last last results.
Nobody was ever been there.
Let's look at a few videos of what you happened to test these drugs drugs in <unk>
These are these are a healthy worms -- and you can see that they move to they move around.
This is on the other side, they have got molecules of protein that they are <unk> in each other inside of them as in humans in humans in humans.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs drugs into that early stages, then we see that they <unk> and live in and live a normal life. life.
This is just a very positive outcome, but research is that we can understand and cure.
After all, of <unk> years years now, of <unk> years now, that you can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But that is to get up to beat the beat Alzheimer's disease, we need a help.
This is not be about scientists like me, this is all about this is this as I am, to you.
We have got to worry about that Alzheimer's is is is is a disease illness, which if we did it, we can <unk> them like that.
In the other case of other patients and their families have was topped more about the governments, industry in <unk>
That was is essential to move forward to as HIV treatment in HIV in the HIV in the 1980s.
Now we can see that same same same unit to overcome the cancer.
But patients are often can't talk about themselves.
And their family families, the victims are hidden hidden the too <unk> too <unk>
So it's really dependent for you about for you.
Alzheimer's is not is, in most cases a genetic disease. disease.
The whole world is with a brain runs the risk.
Today, we have 40 million patients as <unk> the change need to do.
They are talking about for them, and help you to be able to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I was put this this an article in the New York Times, in this year.
In fall in love to do this.
The article is about is a last last summer.
So the procedure is really is a very simple one, two strangers <unk> to be <unk> in for <unk>
Here's a few questions of questions
Number <unk> If you could wake in tomorrow, with a quality or or <unk> what would be? would be?
Number <unk> when's the last last time to go to another person <unk>
And <unk>
And what was we really <unk> the are more and more a little more time.
Number <unk> <unk>
When I came up with this study a few years ago, a really kind was really called me about -- a few years ago, a piece of of the participants had two of the participants were had married to a <unk> months to the <unk>
So I was also <unk> about that this is to make love love love love, but was also <unk>
And when I was the time I had to test this this study, to someone who I knew not particularly very well -- didn't really expect that <unk>
However, we were <unk> and -- -- -- -- and -- -- -- and -- -- -- that was a good story, so I sent to a few months later.
That was in in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in January, in January, that was in
And the reason I think is the one I think this is <unk> me because this is again and over the last seven months.
And this is what I want to talk about today.
But let's go to the subject.
A week before I was published the article was was really nervous.
I had been to work on in the last last few years, years, to write about my experience in my blog.
But a one is a blog can actually come to a few hundreds of you as a very long way to imagined that I was in in the New York Times would probably would probably have a a few thousands you saw.
And that has got a good burden burden is in a relatively new relationship.
But how I had no idea had got to.
The paper was posted on on a line on on a line on on on a line on on line on a Friday night on the night, and he was Saturday, that happened in a Saturday Saturday Saturday did it was happened to the <unk>
And Sunday, I was already called my as I had called me <unk> Show me and <unk> <unk>
In a one of the month, the article was received over 8 million pages, and I was was, for for this kind of attention. attention.
One is one thing is to discover that your loving life has to do.
And when people were people called or a <unk> what they did -- for every day they had every day they did -- -- still follow together?
In fact, when I was really prepared this a talk, I did a search for on the <unk> <unk>
And many different messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and journalists and <unk> like this.
I was sitting in in the radio and you <unk>
But even I gave the talk, and a woman shouted up to the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is you <unk>
And I immediately did I put in red.
I understand that this is is is a deal of thing.
If you write about your relationship to an relationship, you you should expect people to wait for people to get people feel very comfortable at by asking about it.
But I was not not been prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published was a New York Times published -- that the experiences experiences -- study was in them with different different degrees degrees.
So, my first kind is attention is was be is to be very <unk> with my relationship.
I said not every request that we both did -- a public emergence of together. together.
We <unk> and television interviews, refused to take pictures of of us.
I think I was really afraid to be in <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people not want to know only if the study works, they wanted to know if I was capable to be able to make love love.
But this was that was a question that I was not able to respond.
My is my relationship was just a few months ago, I felt, mostly that people did the wrong question.
How do we know if they <unk> together or not, and <unk>
So if the answer was do the experience experience these 36 questions -- less interesting to do this one?
Dr. <unk> <unk> wrote about first about these questions at first about these questions in at this same same same time.
Instead, I was looking for we trying to build interpersonal up by by university students -- called called <unk> <unk> personal <unk> <unk>
Sounds <unk> right?
But the study did it work.
The the participants was felt more feel more felt closer to the later way.
They've been used with it among members the police and police and community and community have been used to the people of the people in <unk>
The <unk> version of the story, the time I was tested in the past summer, was was in in in this article, but unfortunately we <unk>
A few months ago, I was having a talk about in a small little arts university, and he was told me with <unk>
He looked like for for it.
I said, Do you get you <unk> out of the person who you <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I just got better -- but better did that have come better in.
<unk> that did they have got to know better at better after the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't not think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I not think that is be the answer that none of you are is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the first time when I had was I had was 29 to the study when I was was at the first time when I had was I had was 29 to the study when I was in I was in and was when I was in and was when I was with I was was with I was was with I was was with I was was
I'd had that relationship since I had to have 20, which I was supposed to all of the true truth.
So I get myself about in in science.
So I did all I was able to find on all of the heart science.
I don't know what I was thought about at at at the time I thought I was just research for for the book that I wrote really <unk>
I thought that if I was <unk> me <unk> with the great knowledge of romantic love -- the romantic love love love -- the romantic love love romantic love love that romantic love -- romantic love -- the romantic love love romantic love love, the romantic love love romantic love love, the romantic love love, the romantic love love romantic love love, the romantic love love, the romantic love love
And all of this knowledge has been useful in a way or another.
I'm more a patient with love. <unk>
I have more confidence on to which we <unk>
But I can also realize that what I look like that is to me for me.
What is what I'm looking for what love is is is is is is is is is is is is is is an one is an love is is is is is is is is is is is is not just be <unk> in front of the person I love.
It may be is the guarantee that you are people asked when they wanted to know if we were we were all together.
And the story was the media was the media was about about the 36 questions is is that there may be a short short cut off.
There can somehow make us feel beautifully, but also is frightening.
But I think that when it comes to you, are we very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story is the story is you say, still follow together?
And their content is with an content to know or No.
So more more as we did is to ask you how to you say we make you more difficult, questions like, what you decide to decide who she deserves not?
How do is to stay in in in in the time when they were things -- and how do we know when to go and <unk>
How do you live in with the uncertainty that you inevitably comes to -- or even more, how do you live on with your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to what it means means to love somebody.
So, if I want to do a short version of the story story, it is to be a <unk> study for <unk>
But in love is not the same same to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of the <unk> paper was not happened.
It was fallen in love because we just took the choice choice to be.
And I <unk> a a little thing to read it now, -- now, not because it's at the time, it was not be considered everything that is for.
I didn't not consider how many times you would have both to take that choice not to know that election is not to go to the choice or not.
I want to be enough to have done and they responded to the people so generous, and <unk>
But what I've done, instead is is to turn my relationship into the kind I don't really do.
And what would you like -- and what you might as well as I spend my life for looking for that is that that is be true.
I want to be happy in the title of my paper, paper, which I was actually not written.
But what is I try to treat love.
Thank you.
I was -- I was raised by lesbian in high mountain and in and in a certain way, I got to be like a <unk> <unk>
It was a time a time ago.
I'm going to start when I was was eight years.
I took a one <unk> and <unk> a dollar, a <unk> and a <unk> in it somewhere in somewhere in somewhere in in in.
And I thought that a few strangers or some of you could find out of this box -- ideas, for how we do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it is be <unk> because here I am, -- -- -- -- because there I am, -- -- -- because there I am, -- -- that is because there I am, -- -- -- because there I am, -- -- that is because there I am, -- -- -- because there I am, -- -- -- because there I am, -- -- -- because there I am, -- --
At the one was the time I was in <unk> <unk> like I <unk> and all of the <unk> things, and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a whole of the <unk> and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk>
Well, my mother is is fear the bees and it is <unk> to them, to them, to them, so I put more more <unk> as I could <unk>
Instead, it is in some way it looked like it is somehow -- somehow seemed to be as long as increased as it goes up, with a <unk>
So I did I do: build more boxes.
This is this time, I started with things like objects.
So I got up to the objects, and I realized that God can I can design in in space.
I can can I be able to draw the same as you do about a whole <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own <unk> of <unk>
First of all, you are able to be able to have an idea.
Then I did some of the insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I began to ride an exposures and those things and to bring my back to for dinner, for for <unk>
It was -- was -- was a man.
At some point I became interested at by the human form of interested me in in the way a human form of interested in the human form, sculptures of me interested in for that.
It was great, except me <unk>
I didn't not know what to do, because the resin was to the kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to tried to use glass.
So I started drawing in the <unk> layers glass similar to drawing on the window and another other window, and the window and the window together, and had all of these windows together together that they form together that they are together together that they form together that they form together that they form together that they form together that they form together together that they form together together that
And this was really work, and I was able to use the <unk>
So I did for for the years, and my work is with something very big -- that I call <unk>
By the <unk> I was inspired for me as much a great big thing in <unk> <unk>
You <unk>
Well, it's a cool picture.
They say it's a little ahead to your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs about <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has got <unk> face for what is 10 feet of composition.
It's just a little bit weird.
Well, that's one is the source of blood.
On the left, is is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures are with these heads creatures traveled in between between two different worlds.
They are in the world of the <unk> to this is a <unk> mesh of <unk> where you <unk>
This is where the creatures are in the heads creatures are run in the <unk> <unk> lists in the ocean.
The ocean is <unk>
This is is a bird <unk> a <unk>
Billy Graham is in in the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> platform for <unk> <unk>
In all other ways -- a kind of <unk>
It's just been coming out of the ocean, and it spits out the oil into as long as did you get clouds. <unk>
Your hands are as a <unk> and it looks like a being <unk> that holds the Earth and the Earth is <unk>
So it's one kind of look like this.
It's just a little narrative a story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a kind like a <unk> like a <unk> like a bird <unk>
It also has a <unk> feet a snake is <unk>
Anyway, is the tail turn to the <unk> a <unk> <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Its tail ends up in 1986.
They've been <unk>
They were made in in the 1980s, as they were to be baseball cards for terrorists.
It was really got me to my last last project.
I'm in the middle of you -- -- you is called a <unk>
This is be about a six very human beings.
Each is one is is a one is is a one of you -- is our culture, through through through and material is to be <unk> or dictionaries.
But each one is as a kind of acts as as a kind of acts as as a kind sort of acts as as a kind of acts like a kind kind kind of acts as as a kind of acts as as a kind of acts like a kind kind of like a kind sort of acts as as a kind of acts as a kind of file in
They are as they cells, they come together, are both of them.
And you can just walk between them -- is me <unk> years.
Each is basically is basically is a microscope microscope that weighs it weighs for weighs with with a very human human <unk> human. pounds.
This has got a little cave on in <unk>
That's the <unk> is <unk> you can <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to see them for for the rest of the body of the body is -- a one is a waterfall which comes out of the chest, and it takes you a <unk> or <unk>
It's just a quick hip of these works because I can't actually go for for for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is this is a middle body in the half.
This is has two heads, and you're communicating about between the two.
There are some pills out and enter the head of that weird <unk>
There's a a little forest scene inside of in inside of you <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this is this talk is is about that is as we just like the boxes in which we live.
We are in a box, the solar system is is a box.
This brings me to me for my last last box.
It's a called a <unk> <unk>
And inside of that box is -- is an area is a a neuroscientist, a painter, musician, a school arm is <unk>
We <unk> the whole box and all of the people in in inside to each other people in inside to each other people in inside of it up with others as particles.
And I think that is how to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box is in which is you live in.
And together we together, we got to realize that we're all of us in together in that -- that this is that we are different, these concepts concepts work.
We're all all very made out of the same same same matter matter and the same same same matter and the same same same way.
And if we we did not just trade those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when it hurts your head?
They take a whole <unk> off.
But so that is for that this pill has has to have been effect against the stomach, your <unk> and other organs.
And I'm going to take a one is is the most effective system is is the most effective system and the system system is is the most effective system and system system is the system more system is for for that any drug has to be given to have had no effect to be given to have any drug to be made about it to be in the body to
The <unk> though, is is that the <unk> any drug is <unk> up.
And this is this is a big problem, especially in patients in patients.
When are you take some drugs -- these are <unk> to decrease the number of viruses in in the blood, and increase you have cells happen.
But they also are they know by their <unk> side effects in the time it takes to get in the way to the blood and <unk> and even the time it takes to take you to get to get to get to the <unk>
These are these are brain regions like the <unk> <unk> the <unk> system is is <unk> and it doesn't really go very easily <unk>
However, after the ease of the treatment, the virus can actually wake up and infect cells new cells. cells.
This is this is the big problem treatment for HIV as we treatment it is for for <unk> life is in.
One of the day, I felt -- and myself, <unk> making you get the way to the risk of you are <unk> of the <unk>
As I as I was in <unk> the answer was in front of the <unk> of course, of of course.
If you are used to be used to <unk> for <unk> and surgery and surgery are you used to be used for anything to do, including equal to the drugs.
In fact, we are already now using <unk> of laser to open to open up and close to open up and close to open up and close to the cells that we are with HIV to give you drugs.
And best they ask you <unk> <unk>
We sent a very small and powerful beam laser beam about that these cells are embedded in in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug absorbs the drug absorbs the drug absorbs the drug absorbs the drug. drug.
Before we even realize it, the hole is is immediately.
We're actually apply to the human body. technology.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is is through through a three <unk> device.
With the first head, which is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is our laser -- -- in the site of the infection.
The second one is head, which is a camera is is to go to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third is head, a <unk> that distributes is directly directly into in the site site as long as the laser is used to keep the cells open.
Well, this is not seem a long way.
But one day if is this technology is can lead to the HIV total of HIV <unk> the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is is the dream dream is in our case -- a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studied to armed groups and as terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
They <unk> what they do these groups are when they are not are when they are not shoot <unk> when they're not not shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand these more better to these these police agents agents are in the violent involvement to the <unk> violence.
I do this field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is is is is to be really key to in the course, because the war has to be.
It used to be a <unk> amongst states.
Not not.
It's now a conflict between states and actors.
For example, the <unk> deals peace deals you for <unk> peace to 2011, they were signed up in between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we have we got to be able to understand these <unk> we may even have we been able to be able to understand these <unk> we even have got to be able to understand these <unk> we even have got to be able to understand these <unk> we even have got to be able to understand these <unk> we even have got to be able to understand these <unk>
But how do we do that?
We need to know what it is motivates these organizations.
We know very good for the reasons that we <unk> how they were, how do they do it, but no one is do it as they don't <unk>
The bus struggle and the policies are not <unk> are not <unk> in <unk>
It's all of the same same same same same time.
We can't really understand these groups, and not a global view.
Living <unk> groups are are very complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> met by their violent roof <unk> against against Israel.
From their creation is from their creation in <unk> has also established a set of a social media network and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> met by their suicide attacks against against since 2007.
So these groups are people do more than simply by to just shooting.
They're multitasking up.
It was <unk> a a lot of a complex <unk> stations stations stations and on the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here they have the <unk> magazine <unk> in English and published to <unk>
armed groups are they also invest in a complex complex fundraising <unk> but through <unk> for example, <unk>
These are activities are key.
They allow these groups groups to increase their <unk> to increase them better and building their brand. brand.
<unk> groups are also makes more stronger ties with their population more ties by investing in social services.
They build a schools, they run in hospitals, they put in their professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> is offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are to try to conquer the population of you will not be security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in in in in <unk> in the war or even the beginning of the <unk> ascent can you understand the also looked at the efforts efforts can be understood to the beginning of the beginning of the <unk> ascent can also be <unk> at the efforts of these groups to give safety.
Unfortunately, in in these cases, security is has a price price price for for the population.
But in all, it will provide social services means is to create a social services that means is a <unk> gap for <unk> by by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory is in the Palestinian Hamas can't <unk> without recognizing the social work.
It's a kind of really complex -- even in the West, when we looked at the on the violent side side. groups.
But that's not not enough to be able to understand the strengths of the strengths strategy for the strategy or long-term vision. is to do.
These are groups are are <unk>
They <unk> because they fill in gaps in the government, and political groups are and political groups, and political groups, and political groups, and political groups, and political and political groups, and political groups, and political groups, and political groups, and political groups, and political groups, and political groups, armed and <unk>
And the more the more you have these organizations, you are organizations, you are more a way to like a different state.
How do we say a group like <unk>
<unk> a part of the one -- is with all of the <unk> collect these collected out of all these collect these collected out of all collect these collected out of all these collect collect these collected out of these collect all of these collect all of these collect all these collect all together, collect these collected out of these collect all of these collect all of these collect all
It's a way a <unk> group.
Or is something something else, something new and different.
And what is you <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in in a world world.
This is important to governments, because to do that to governments, these groups of you will have to invest more in tools in not military tools. tools.
We <unk> that government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is also to be set up and the peace peace.
If we do better better at the groups groups we would better better that if we have to offer to foster the violence to the violence. violence.
In the whole new <unk> between states and actors, states can can make a peace or stability.
To get these targets long-term investments we need to fill that vacuum vacuum that it allows these groups to thrive in in a very beginning.
Thank you.

For me, these truths are are <unk> but to be a good <unk>
I'm just full of <unk>
There's a whole bunch of things they make for a bad feminist. feminist.

The problem is is that our women are economically vulnerable in in so much that makes women do women are economically economically vulnerable in in so much that makes women do women are economically economically vulnerable in in so much that makes women make women economically economically vulnerable in so vulnerable to when we are.
We <unk> this a problem.

And it's also happens to be like this: as a feminist, <unk> <unk>

So we hope that they will <unk> the good perfection. real perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> was very good at the same same <unk> where do you look at them.

We don't need to do that.
Good <unk> or more <unk> is is is the point of <unk>
But what happens next? happen next?
We went from in the <unk> to a day, is a little more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am -- I'm creating a demand for the artists to be more happy to give you a better money supply for limitless.
These artists will not change how to talk about women in their songs until it is affecting affecting affect affecting affecting affecting affect the affecting affecting means affecting affecting us.
Certainly it's hard.
Why is the music to be so <unk>
It's really hard to be able to get something better and so easy to justify a better <unk>
But when the good choices are decisions do this is more decisions that makes it be more hard for women to achieve equality, the equality is all we deserve to do is to do.
I think of in my <unk> three and four years old.
It's just <unk> <unk> <unk> and very bright and <unk> and very brave.
Where are they are interested in by the strong creatures they are.
I think about -- all of a sudden, a sudden the best best option would best get better -- as much more easy to do.
We all can make better decisions.
Can we change the channel when a TV program tries to treat violence sexual violence.
We can change the radio radio when when we heard about the women like anything.
We can actually spend our money money to go to the movie when the movies are like <unk> objects.

We can also tell that with the motions our feminism, good <unk> bad or any <unk> in them.
The last line of of my book is <unk> <unk> is a very bad <unk>
This is true -- because of lots of reasons, but I mean -- to me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what it happened.
Some of the guys were <unk> when I was a very young guys to me when I was -- was when I was a young guys to me when I was -- was when I was a young guys to me when I was -- was when I was a young guys to me when I was -- was when I was a young guys to me when I was
I was treated me as it was at all.
I started believing it was not anything.
And I <unk> my voice, and after I all did is something that could matter.
But I was writing. at writing.
And I got back to <unk>
I was in in a stronger version of myself.
And I was read about how to do that meant to live in in the world.
I read the words of the women they showed me that was not nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I began to believe that my voice is beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing was also what happened to tell us who we are.
In one of the power to do anything.
And in the other, is I argue the hopeful reality is that I'm just a woman.
I'm a kind of a bad <unk>
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we all can be a little bit a little bit to as a more you need to be a little courage to be.
Right after last year, the year was -- -- the children in the children who had been been there.
The virus is then went to the border to Canada, we <unk> more than 100 kids in in.
One is one of the diseases are most likely to <unk>
There is to be afraid of something supposed to do.
But a one was a time, it was not be the article that unleashed the argument were unleashed the argument about about about <unk> and <unk> and marked by being an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It doesn't believe that the theory that vaccines are cause autism is is a <unk> <unk>
I think that I think you know, but millions of parents all are all over the world are all following the vaccines to put the vaccines to put vaccines in danger to their children.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the estimates have autism in the time.
During the most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very whole disease disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had I heard about to talk about they create a only case.
For for decades, the estimates estimates they are just three to four or four children by <unk>
But then, in in the '90s, the numbers started to <unk>
They <unk> like a <unk> <unk> which is as if I could have another other kid in in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not be vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people to the people in the people at the people to the people at the people to the people in the people in the people to the people at the people to the people at the people to the people at the people to the people at the people to the people at the people to the people at the people to the people at the
But that kind is not <unk> a lot of the baby fears is not <unk>
If I was the diagnostic was they had to get to know it, why are they were so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were these cases cases so hard to find out before the <unk> <unk> in it.
Five years ago, I decided to find out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to do with is less is to do with with is as much is to do with the slow progress progress is the matter of the science that science comes to the <unk>
For the most of the 20th century, the doctors told you a story about what the autism was and discovered, was but that story was is to be <unk> and the whole story was turned out to be <unk> and the the story was turned out to be <unk> and the the story was turned out to be <unk> and the the story was turned out to be fake, and
There was a second more accurate history of history that had been lost and forgotten at the dark corners literature.
This is this second second story tells us all about how we got to go.
The first story starts with a <unk> technological worlds.
They could have fun for hours by hours by waving your hands their hands up to the hands to you as they were <unk> <unk>
Over the base of the patients are treated in in their clinic, <unk> <unk> <unk>
For the age of the years as we had to make references in places as South South Africa.
This is actually not because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because the <unk> criteria was because
For example, are we going to give you to give you that diagnosis to children but we now know the epilepsy is very common in autism.
And once it was <unk> that he had become nine in every 10 children to being autistic without to give you a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was was a smart guy, but part of their theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as as a form of as a child is caused by cold and <unk>
These children said, they kept carefully carefully at in in a refrigerator that <unk>
At the same same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of the young people patients had to be music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between the <unk> before before I turned out of the years before I turned to.
When her mother got one of his favorite records ones, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had had a bad view of these skills skills, stating that what they had to have heard to their parents to die by what they had to have heard to their parents to die by what they had to have heard to their parents to die by what they had to have heard to their parents to be willing to win what they had to have heard to
As a result, autism became as a source of <unk> for families, two generations of were autistic were to be sent to the institutions to be sent to the institutions to be sent to the institutions to be sent to the institutions to the institutions for for families, two generations children were autistic were sent to be sent to the other to be sent to the institutions to the institutions
Amazingly, was not even go to the way to the early 1970s, the researchers started the researchers started to test the <unk> theory that the autism was was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
She and her was John was was warm and were warm people and <unk> and had a daughter autistic autistic daughter.
<unk> and John knew how hard was you to raise a child as <unk> without special education, no special access to other resources resources at all.
In order to be in in at the first of the time to the National Geographic Service, we needed more resources needed to be done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in in the general population.
<unk> an London suburb to the community.
What you saw is that the <unk> model was was too was a much more <unk> and diverse one.
Some of the kids could not speak at the other while others were <unk> in their fascination in the <unk>
In other kids did not fit in beautiful and they saw a lot more more than the <unk> <unk> <unk>
At first, they were missing to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one had not been <unk> of these children before?
But then I did -- found a one reference to a <unk> paper published in <unk> the next year to the next year is to be buried buried down, under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody had ever remember.
<unk> I knew I knew about this item in competition, but avoided a <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but for he was was spoken to her.
The document is offers a whole other thing for autism.
His was was a man named Hans <unk> <unk> who was an integrated into school in in in in in the 1930s.
The ideas ideas for for kids to teach them with were a lot of <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and kids were just followed the <unk>
Instead of blame the parent of the parents of the parents to cause autism, <unk> described the life as <unk> for <unk> for <unk> <unk>
Instead of treat children in their clinic as a patients, has Asperger's was calling them to be in the development of education methods for for them.
And the <unk> is kind of the disability.
He believed that thought that autism and <unk> were autistic were all have been, to look at how this was in in common <unk> <unk>
He was beyond even until I said that for success in science and art, a grain is is <unk>
<unk> and Judith did they found that <unk> was <unk> was as well as they were parents were the <unk>
Over the next years, they worked on in in the next few years, they worked in silent in the next years, to expand the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the <unk> the early '90s, the changes were in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> the very limited model of <unk> by by by a broad broad and <unk>
These are changes don't all fell in a broken bag.
<unk> when you <unk> and Judith was working on.
Before I was <unk> I was in in in a 1988, just a small circle, was <unk> by by by by by experts in in by experts in in the experts knew what the autism, was but after <unk> as they <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>
At the same same time, introduced to the first same same same same same same same time, it was introduced to the first very early easy care trials to use to use to diagnose the autism.
I was not had a connection to with that little word experts have to do for for his son.
The combination of the <unk> would change the changes are the changes at the criteria and the introduction and the introduction is the awareness of autism.
The number of the diagnostics started and the services are services are and the services services.
So then Andrew <unk> did we blame for the <unk> vaccines for the increase is in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> makes a credible credible story.
If we have the current estimate is that prevention prevention is in America are in in the U.S. is is -- is -- is -- is -- is really -- is the <unk> the one of the largest groups groups in the world.
In the last years, people autistic people are people autistic have joined them on on the Internet to <unk> the idea that they are puzzles are puzzles are puzzles together on in the last few years.
One way to understand the <unk> is to think in in terms of in terms of in human operating systems.
The fact the fact was the fact that it works is not mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> the normal human brain is is easily <unk> -- -- is to the <unk>
We don't doubt people are people autistic are people have a hard trouble people are having a hard trouble people are struggling to have a hard trouble people are having hard to live in a world built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> that creates that the <unk> is for the most <unk> aspects are parents are in in in for the most other autism <unk> are found in in in the understanding of the teachers, employers are still getting to <unk> which creates the way for for most of the most <unk> aspects are parents are in in in in for the most <unk> aspects
A <unk> woman named <unk> <unk> said, "We need all the hands of you <unk> the <unk>
As we move to the future we need all of we need all of the human human intelligence forms on the planet to make in front of the challenges that we face as society.
We can't afford to afford a brain.
Thank you.
